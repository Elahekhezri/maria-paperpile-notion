Much work remains to be done to mitigate\nthe serious harms of these systems, particularly those\ndisproportionately affecting marginalized communities. Despite\nthese ongoing harms, new systems are being developed and\ndeployed, typically without strong regulatory barriers,\nthreatening the perpetuation of the same harms and the creation\nof novel ones. In response, the FATE community has emphasized\nthe importance of anticipating harms, rather than just\nresponding to them. Anticipation of harms is especially\nimportant given the rapid pace of developments in machine\nlearning (ML). Our work focuses on the anticipation of harms\nfrom increasingly agentic systems. Rather than providing a\ndefinition of agency as a binary property, we identify 4 key\ncharacteristics which, particularly in combination, tend to\nincrease the agency of a given algorithmic system:\nunderspecification, directness of impact, goal-directedness, and\nlong-term planning. We also discuss important harms which arise\nfrom increasing agency -- notably, these include systemic and/or\nlong-range impacts, often on marginalized or unconsidered\nstakeholders. We emphasize that recognizing agency of\nalgorithmic systems does not absolve or shift the human\nresponsibility for algorithmic harms. Rather, we use the term\nagency to highlight the increasingly evident fact that ML\nsystems are not fully under human control. Our work explores\nincreasingly agentic algorithmic systems in three parts. First,\nwe explain the notion of an increase in agency for algorithmic\nsystems in the context of diverse perspectives on agency across\ndisciplines.

METHODS: We used data from the\nPregnancy Mortality Surveillance System and calculated\npregnancy-related mortality ratios by year and age group for\nfour race-ethnicity groups: non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic\nblack, Hispanic, and other. We examined causes of\npregnancy-related deaths by pregnancy outcome during 2006-2010\nand compared causes of pregnancy-related deaths since 1987.\nRESULTS: The 2006-2010 pregnancy-related mortality ratio was\n16.0 deaths per 100,000 live births (20,959,533 total live\nbirths). Specific race-ethnicity pregnancy-related mortality\nratios were 12.0, 38.9, 11.7, and 14.2 deaths per 100,000 live\nbirths for non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, Hispanic,\nand other race women, respectively. Pregnancy-related\nmortality ratios increased with maternal age for all women and\nwithin all age groups, non-Hispanic black women had the\nhighest risk of dying from pregnancy complications. Over time,\nthe contribution to pregnancy-related deaths of hemorrhage,\nhypertensive disorders of pregnancy, embolism, and anesthesia\ncomplications continued to decline, whereas the contribution\nof cardiovascular conditions and infection increased. Seven of\n10 categories of causes of death each contributed from 9.4\\%\nto 14.6\\% of all 2006-2010 pregnancy-related deaths;\ncardiovascular conditions ranked first.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the ability\nof an AI chatbot assistant (ChatGPT), released in November\n2022, to provide quality and empathetic responses to patient\nquestions. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this\ncross-sectional study, a public and nonidentifiable database\nof questions from a public social media forum (Reddit's\nr/AskDocs) was used to randomly draw 195 exchanges from\nOctober 2022 where a verified physician responded to a public\nquestion. Chatbot responses were generated by entering the\noriginal question into a fresh session (without prior\nquestions having been asked in the session) on December 22 and\n23, 2022. The original question along with anonymized and\nrandomly ordered physician and chatbot responses were\nevaluated in triplicate by a team of licensed health care\nprofessionals. Evaluators chose ``which response was better''\nand judged both ``the quality of information provided'' (very\npoor, poor, acceptable, good, or very good) and ``the empathy\nor bedside manner provided'' (not empathetic, slightly\nempathetic, moderately empathetic, empathetic, and very\nempathetic).

Here we show, in the context of\ninformation and media diffusion, that high-dimensional\nadjustment of a nonexperimental control group (660 million\nobservations) using propensity score models produces estimates\nof peer effects statistically indistinguishable from those\nusing a large randomized experiment (215 million\nobservations). Compared with the experiment, naive\nobservational estimators overstate peer effects by over 300\\%\nand commonly available variables (e.g., demographics) offer\nlittle bias reduction. Adjusting for a measure of prior\nbehaviors closely related to the focal behavior reduces this\nbias by 91\\%, while models adjusting for over 3700 past\nbehaviors provide additional bias reduction, reducing bias by\nover 97\\%, which is statistically indistinguishable from\nunbiasedness. This demonstrates how detailed records of\nbehavior can improve studies of social influence, information\ndiffusion, and imitation; these results are encouraging for\nthe credibility of some studies but also cautionary for\nstudies of peer effects in rare or new behaviors.

Strict use of this P value may lead to strategies of\nclinical researchers to describe their clinical results with P\nvalues approaching but not reaching the threshold to be\n``almost significant.'' The question is how phrases expressing\nnonsignificant results have been reported in RCTs over the\npast 30 years. To this end, we conducted a quantitative\nanalysis of English full texts containing 567,758 RCTs\nrecorded in PubMed between 1990 and 2020 (81.5\\% of all\npublished RCTs in PubMed). We determined the exact presence of\n505 predefined phrases denoting results that approach but do\nnot cross the line of formal statistical significance (P <\n0.05). We modeled temporal trends in phrase data with Bayesian\nlinear regression. Evidence for temporal change was obtained\nthrough Bayes factor (BF) analysis. In a randomly sampled\nsubset, the associated P values were manually extracted. We\nidentified 61,741 phrases in 49,134 RCTs indicating almost\nsignificant results (8.65\\%; 95\\% confidence interval (CI):\n8.58\\% to 8.73\\%). The overall prevalence of these phrases\nremained stable over time, with the most prevalent phrases\nbeing ``marginally significant'' (in 7,735 RCTs), ``all but\nsignificant'' (7,015), ``a nonsignificant trend'' (3,442),\n``failed to reach statistical significance'' (2,578), and ``a\nstrong trend'' (1,700). The strongest evidence for an\nincreased temporal prevalence was found for ``a numerical\ntrend,'' ``a positive trend,'' ``an increasing trend,'' and\n``nominally significant.'' In contrast, the phrases ``all but\nsignificant,'' ``approaches statistical significance,'' ``did\nnot quite reach statistical significance,'' ``difference was\napparent,'' ``failed to reach statistical significance,'' and\n``not quite significant'' decreased over time. In a random\nsampled subset of 29,000 phrases, the manually identified and\ncorresponding 11,926 P values, 68,1\\% ranged between 0.05 and\n0.15 (CI: 67. to 69.0; median 0.06). Our results show that RCT\nreports regularly contain specific phrases describing\nmarginally nonsignificant results to report P values close to\nbut above the dominant 0.05 cutoff.

We also wanted to characterize\ntemporal trends in these narrative frameworks on the sites\nover the study period. METHODS: To ensure that our data\ncapture long-term discussions and not short-term reactions to\nrecent events, we developed a dataset of 1.99 million posts\ncontributed by 40,056 users and viewed 20.12 million times\nindexed from 2 parenting sites over a period of 105 months.\nUsing probabilistic methods, we determined the topics of\ndiscussion on these parenting sites. We developed a generative\nstatistical-mechanical narrative model to automatically\nextract the underlying stories and story fragments from\nmillions of posts. We aggregated the stories into an\noverarching narrative framework graph. In our model, stories\nwere represented as network graphs with actants as nodes and\ntheir various relationships as edges. We estimated the latent\nstories circulating on these sites by modeling the posts as a\nsampling of the hidden narrative framework graph. Temporal\ntrends were examined based on monthly user-poststatistics.\nRESULTS: We discovered that discussions of exemption from\nvaccination requirements are highly represented. We found a\nstrong narrative framework related to exemption seeking and a\nculture of distrust of government and medical institutions.\nVarious posts reinforced part of the narrative framework graph\nin which parents, medical professionals, and religious\ninstitutions emerged as key nodes, and exemption seeking\nemerged as an important edge. In the aggregate story, parents\nused religion or belief to acquire exemptions to protect their\nchildren from vaccines that are required by schools or\ngovernment institutions, but (allegedly) cause adverse\nreactions such as autism, pain, compromised immunity, and even\ndeath. Although parents joined and left the discussion forums\nover time, discussions and stories about exemptions were\npersistent and robust to these membership changes.\nCONCLUSIONS: Analyzing parent forums about health care using\nan automated analytic approach, such as the one presented\nhere, allows the detection of widespread narrative frameworks\nthat structure and inform discussions. In most vaccination\nstories from the sites we analyzed, it is taken for granted\nthat vaccines and not vaccine preventable diseases (VPDs) pose\na threat to children. Because vaccines are seen as a threat,\nparents focus on sharing successful strategies for avoiding\nthem, with exemption being the foremost among these\nstrategies. When new parents join such sites, they may be\nexposed to this endemic narrative framework in the threads\nthey read and to which they contribute, which may influence\ntheir health care decision making.", "keywords": "Internet; attitudes; health knowledge; machine learning;\npersonal narratives; practice; social media;\nvaccination;favorites \ud83d\udc95;narrative"}, {"title": "Towards Automatic Narrative Coherence Prediction", "authors": "Filip Bendevski, Jumana Ibrahim, Krulec  Tina And Waters  Theodore, Nizar Habash, Salam  Hanan And Mukherjee  Himadri, Christin Camia", "year": "2021", "ref_id": "Bendevski2021-zf", "link": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3462244.3479895", "abstract": "Research in Psychology has shown that stories people tell about\nthemselves, and how they recall their experiences, reveal a lot\nabout their individual characteristics and mental well-being.\nThe Narrative Coherence Coding Scheme (NaCCS) is a set of\nguidelines established in psychology research for annotating the\n``coherence'' of a narrative along three dimensions: context,\nchronology and theme.

We find that there is extensive difficulty in\npredicting the best source due to the complex interactions\nbetween genres, parsers, and LMs. Additionally, the influence of\nthe data used to derive the underlying BERT model heavily\ninfluences how best to create more robust and effective\ncross-genre parsing models.", "keywords": "subdomains"}, {"title": "Evaluating A Topic Modelling Approach To Measuring Corpus Similarity", "authors": "Richard Fothergill, Paul Cook, Timothy Baldwin", "year": "2016", "ref_id": "Fothergill2016-pc", "link": "https://aclanthology.org/L16-1042", "abstract": "Web corpora are often constructed automatically, and their\ncontents are therefore often not well understood.

OBJECTIVE: This study investigates\npublic attitudes toward possibly contributing to digital\nhealth research repositories to identify factors for their\nacceptance and to inform future developments. METHODS: A\ncross-sectional online survey was conducted from March 2020 to\nDecember 2020. Because of the funded project scope and a\nmulticenter collaboration, study recruitment targeted young\nadults in Denmark and Brazil, allowing an analysis of the\ndifferences between 2 very contrasting national contexts.\nThrough closed-ended questions, the survey examined\nparticipants' willingness to share different data types, data\naccess preferences, reasons for concern, and motivations to\ncontribute. The survey also collected information about\nparticipants' demographics, level of interest in health\ntopics, previous participation in health research, awareness\nof examples of existing research data repositories, and\ncurrent attitudes about digital health research repositories.\nData analysis consisted of descriptive frequency measures and\nstatistical inferences (bivariate associations and logistic\nregressions). RESULTS: The sample comprises 1017 respondents\nliving in Brazil (1017/1600, 63.56\\%) and 583 in Denmark\n(583/1600, 36.44\\%).

The analysis shows a vast majority were very\nmotivated by helping future patients (1366/1600, 85.38\\%) and\nresearchers (1253/1600, 78.31\\%), yet very concerned about\nunethical projects (1219/1600, 76.19\\%), profit making without\nconsent (1096/1600, 68.50\\%), and cyberattacks (1055/1600,\n65.94\\%). Participants' willingness to share data is lower\nwhen sharing personal sensing data, such as the content of\ncalls and texts (1206/1600, 75.38\\%), in contrast to more\ntraditional health research information. Only 13.44\\%\n(215/1600) find it desirable to grant data access to private\ncompanies, and most would like to stay informed about which\nprojects use their data (1334/1600, 83.38\\%) and control\nfuture data access (1181/1600, 73.81\\%). Findings indicate\nthat favorable attitudes toward digital health research\nrepositories are related to a personal interest in health\ntopics (odds ratio [OR] 1.49, 95\\% CI 1.10-2.02; P=.01),\nprevious participation in health research studies (OR 1.70,\n95\\% CI 1.24-2.35; P=.001), and awareness of examples of\nresearch repositories (OR 2.78, 95\\% CI 1.83-4.38; P<.001).\nCONCLUSIONS: This study reveals essential factors for\nacceptance and willingness to share personal data with digital\nhealth research repositories.

RESULTS: Our\nkeyword search identified 58 videos that met the criteria for\ninclusion, including 48 videos that featured individuals who\nremoved an intrauterine device and 10 who removed an implant.\nCollectively, videos had over 4 million views.

STUDY DESIGN: We studied English-language\ntweets mentioning reversible prescription contraceptive\nmethods between March 2006 (founding of Twitter) and December\n2019. Tweets mentioning contraception were extracted using\nsearch terms, including generic or brand names, colloquial\nnames, and abbreviations. We characterized and performed\nsentiment analysis on tweets. We used Mann-Kendall\nnonparametric tests to assess temporal trends in the overall\nnumber and the number of positive, negative, and neutral\ntweets referring to each method. The code to reproduce this\nanalysis is available at\nhttps://github.com/hms-dbmi/contraceptionOnTwitter. RESULTS:\nWe extracted 838,739 tweets mentioning at least 1\ncontraceptive method. The annual number of\ncontraception-related tweets increased considerably over the\nstudy period. The intrauterine device was the most commonly\nreferenced method (45.9\\%). Long-acting methods were mentioned\nmore often than short-acting ones (58\\% vs 42\\%), and the\nannual proportion of long-acting reversible\ncontraception-related tweets increased over time. In sentiment\nanalysis of tweets mentioning a single contraceptive method\n(n=665,064), the greatest proportion of all tweets was\nnegative (65,339 of 160,713 tweets with at least 95\\%\nconfident sentiment, or 40.66\\%).

The\nmain argument is that the market-based categories of genre that\nhave been developed in the context of video games obscure the new\nmedium's crucial defining feature, by dividing them into\ncategories (loosely) organized by their similarities to prior\nforms of mediation. The article explores the inherent tension\nbetween the conception of video games as a unified new media\nform, and the current fragmented genre-based approach that\nexplicitly or implicitly concatenates video games with prior\nmedia forms. This tension reflects the current debate, within the\nfledgling discipline of Game Studies, between those who advocate\nnarrative as the primary tool for understanding video games,\n``narratologists,'' and those that oppose this notion,\n``ludologists.'' In reference to this tension, the article argues\nthat video game genres be examined in order to assess what kind\nof assumptions stem from the uncritical acceptance of genre as a\ndescriptive category. Through a critical examination of the key\ngame genres, this article will demonstrate how the clearly\ndefined genre boundaries collapse to reveal structural\nsimilarities between the genres that exist within the current\ngenre system, defined within the context of visual aesthetic or\nnarrative structure. The inability of the current genre\ndescriptions to locate and highlight these particular features\nsuggests that to privilege the categories of the visual and\nnarrative is a failure to understand the medium.

These data\ncan provide timely illustrations of how individuals discuss\nmiscarriages and preterm births, as well as insights into the\nwellbeing of women who have experienced a miscarriage. Here we\naim to characterise how users discuss the topic of miscarriage\nand preterm births on Twitter, analyse trends and drivers, and\ndescribe the perceived emotional state of women who have\nexperienced a miscarriage. METHODS: We obtained 291 443\nTwitter postings on miscarriages and preterm births from\nJanuary 2017 through December 2018. Latent Dirichlet\nAllocation (LDA) was used to identify major topics of\ndiscussion. We applied time series decomposition methods to\nassess temporal trends and identify major drivers of\ndiscussion. Furthermore, four coders labelled the emotional\ncontent of 7282 personal miscarriage disclosure tweets into\nthe following non-mutually exclusive categories:\ngrief/sadness/depression, anger, relief, isolation, annoyance,\nand neutral. RESULTS: Topics in our data fell into eight\ngroups: celebrity disclosures, Michelle Obama's disclosure,\npolitics, healthcare, preterm births, loss and anxiety, flu\nvaccine and ectopic pregnancies. Political discussions around\nmiscarriages were largely due to a misunderstanding between\nabortions and miscarriages. Grief and annoyance were the most\ncommonly expressed emotions within the miscarriage\nself-disclosures; 50.6\\% (95\\% confidence interval [CI] 49.1,\n52.2) and 16.2\\% (95\\% CI 15.2, 17.3). Postings increased with\ncelebrity disclosures, pharmacists' refusal of prescribed\nmedications and outrage over the high rate of preterm births\nin the United States. Miscarriage disclosures by celebrities\nalso led to disclosures by women who had similar experiences.\nCONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that increase in discussions\nof miscarriage on social media are associated with several\nfactors, including celebrity disclosures.

The paper explains\nthese results by identi- fying weaknesses of current nonlinear\ntechniques, and suggests how the performance of nonlinear\ndimensionality reduction techniques may be improved.\",\njournal  = \"Journal of machine learning research: JMLR\",\nvolume   =  10,\nnumber   = \"February\",\npages    = \"1--41\",\nyear     =  2009,\nurl      = \"http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13506280444000102\",\nfile     = \"All Papers/V/van der Maaten et al. 2009 - Dimensionality Reduction - A Comparative Review.pdf\",\nkeywords = \"dimensionality reduction; feature extraction; manifold\nlearning;Inspiration\",\nissn     = \"1532-4435, 0169-328X\",\npmid     = \"7877450\",\ndoi      = \"10.1080/13506280444000102\"\n}\n\n@ARTICLE{Hogg2010-zx,\ntitle    = \"{Data analysis recipes: Fitting a model to data}\",\nauthor   = \"Hogg, David W and Bovy, Jo and Lang, Dustin\",\nabstract = \"We go through the many considerations involved in fitting a model\nto data, using as an example the fit of a straight line to a set\nof points in a two-dimensional plane.

The greater variation in some styles (e.g.,\nspontaneous speech and infant-directed speech) poses challenges\nfor recognition but possibly also opportunities for learning more\nrobust models, as evidenced by prior work and motivated by child\nlanguage acquisition studies. In order to investigate this\npossibility, this work proposes a new method for characterizing\nspeaking style (the modulation spectrum), examines spontaneous,\nread, adult-directed, and infant-directed styles in this space,\nand conducts pilot experiments in style detection and sampling\nfor improved speech recognizer training. Speaking style\nclassification is improved by using the modulation spectrum in\ncombination with standard pitch and energy variation.

We replicate a spectrum of standard\nhuman biases as exposed by the Implicit Association Test and\nother well-known psychological studies.

Using reconstructed transcripts of\ndebates held in the Revolution's first parliament, we present\na quantitative analysis of how this body managed innovation.\nWe use information theory to track the creation, transmission,\nand destruction of word-use patterns across over 40,000\nspeeches and a thousand speakers. The parliament as a whole\nwas biased toward the adoption of new patterns, but speakers'\nindividual qualities could break these overall trends.\nSpeakers on the left innovated at higher rates, while speakers\non the right acted to preserve prior patterns. Key players\nsuch as Robespierre (on the left) and Abb{\\'e} Maury (on the\nright) played information-processing roles emblematic of their\npolitics. Newly created organizational functions-such as the\nAssembly president and committee chairs-had significant\neffects on debate outcomes, and a distinct transition appears\nmidway through the parliament when committees, external to the\ndebate process, gained new powers to ``propose and dispose.''\nTaken together, these quantitative results align with existing\nqualitative interpretations, but also reveal crucial\ninformation-processing dynamics that have hitherto been\noverlooked.

Demand for non-face-to-face care, such as\ncommunication through a patient portal and administrative\ntasks, is increasing and contributing to burnout. The goal of\nthis study was to assess time allocated by primary care\nphysicians within the EHR as indicated by EHR user-event log\ndata, both during clinic hours (defined as 8:00 am to 6:00 pm\nMonday through Friday) and outside clinic hours. METHODS: We\nconducted a retrospective cohort study of 142 family medicine\nphysicians in a single system in southern Wisconsin. All Epic\n(Epic Systems Corporation) EHR interactions were captured from\n``event logging'' records over a 3-year period for both direct\npatient care and non-face-to-face activities, and were\nvalidated by direct observation. EHR events were assigned to 1\nof 15 EHR task categories and allocated to either during or\nafter clinic hours. RESULTS: Clinicians spent 355 minutes (5.9\nhours) of an 11.4-hour workday in the EHR per weekday per 1.0\nclinical full-time equivalent: 269 minutes (4.5 hours) during\nclinic hours and 86 minutes (1.4 hours) after clinic hours.\nClerical and administrative tasks including documentation,\norder entry, billing and coding, and system security accounted\nfor nearly one-half of the total EHR time (157 minutes,\n44.2\\%).

CONCLUSIONS: Primary care physicians spend more than\none-half of their workday, nearly 6 hours, interacting with\nthe EHR during and after clinic hours.

The\nfindings from the scoping review, in addition to the\nframework, provide the backbone of detailed policy\nrecommendations from the ACP to external stakeholders (such as\npayers, governmental oversight organizations, and vendors)\nregarding how any given administrative requirement,\nregulation, or program should be assessed, then potentially\nrevised or removed entirely.\",\njournal     = \"Annals of internal medicine\",\nvolume      =  166,\nnumber      =  9,\npages       = \"659--661\",\nmonth       =  \"2~\" # may,\nyear        =  2017,\nurl         = \"http://dx.doi.org/10.7326/M16-2697\",\nfile        = \"All Papers/E/Erickson et al. 2017 - Putting Patients First by Reducing Administrative ...

Outpatient clinical notes document\ncare, communicate treatment plans and support patient safety,\nmedical education, medico-legal investigations and\nreimbursement. Accurately describing and assessing quality of\nclinical documentation is a necessary improvement in an\nincreasingly team-based healthcare delivery system. In this\npaper we describe the quality of outpatient clinical notes\nfrom the perspective of multiple stakeholders. METHODS: Using\npurposeful sampling for maximum diversity, we conducted focus\ngroups and individual interviews with clinicians, nursing and\nancillary staff, patients, and healthcare administrators at\nsix federal health care facilities between 2009 and 2011. All\nsessions were audio-recorded, transcribed and qualitatively\nanalyzed using open, axial and selective coding. RESULTS: The\n163 participants included 61 clinicians, 52 nurse/ancillary\nstaff, 31 patients and 19 administrative staff. Three\norganizing themes emerged: 1) characteristics of quality in\nclinical notes, 2) desired elements within the clinical notes\nand 3) system supports to improve the quality of clinical\nnotes. We identified 11 codes to describe characteristics of\nclinical notes, 20 codes to describe desired elements in\nquality clinical notes and 11 codes to describe clinical\nsystem elements that support quality when writing clinical\nnotes. While there was substantial overlap between the aspects\nof quality described by the four stakeholder groups, only\nclinicians and administrators identified ease of translation\ninto billing codes as an important characteristic of a quality\nnote. Only patients rated prioritization of their medical\nproblems as an aspect of quality. Nurses included care and\neducation delivered to the patient, information added by the\npatient, interdisciplinary information, and infection alerts\nas important content. CONCLUSIONS: Perspectives of these four\nstakeholder groups provide a comprehensive description of\nquality in outpatient clinical documentation. The resulting\ndescription of characteristics and content necessary for\nquality notes provides a research-based foundation for\nassessing the quality of clinical documentation in outpatient\nhealth care settings.\",\njournal     = \"BMC health services research\",\nvolume      =  12,\npages       = \"407\",\nmonth       =  \"19~\" # nov,\nyear        =  2012,\nurl         = \"http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1472-6963-12-407\",\nfile        = \"All Papers/H/Hanson et al. 2012 - Quality of outpatient clinical notes - a stakeholder definition derived through qualitative research.pdf\",\nkeywords    = \"Intelligent Scribe;2018 MSR\",\nlanguage    = \"en\",\nissn        = \"1472-6963\",\npmid        = \"23164470\",\ndoi         = \"10.1186/1472-6963-12-407\",\npmc         = \"PMC3529118\"\n}\n\n@ARTICLE{Bank2013-me,\ntitle       = \"{Impact of scribes on patient interaction, productivity, and\nrevenue in a cardiology clinic: a prospective study}\",\nauthor      = \"Bank, Alan J and Obetz, Christopher and Konrardy, Ann and\nKhan, Akbar and Pillai, Kamalesh M and McKinley, Benjamin J\nand Gage, Ryan M and Turnbull, Mark A and Kenney, William O\",\naffiliation = \"United heart and Vascular Clinic, St Paul, MN, USA.\",\nabstract    = \"OBJECTIVE: Scribes have been used in the emergency department\nto improve physician productivity and patient interaction.\nThere are no controlled, prospective studies of scribe use in\nthe clinic setting.

Hence, there is growing\ninterest among the research community for developing new\napproaches to automatically summarize the text. Automatic text\nsummarization system generates a summary, i.e. short length text\nthat includes all the important information of the document.\nSince the advent of text summarization in 1950s, researchers have\nbeen trying to improve techniques for generating summaries so\nthat machine generated summary matches with the human made\nsummary. Summary can be generated through extractive as well as\nabstractive methods. Abstractive methods are highly complex as\nthey need extensive natural language processing. Therefore,\nresearch community is focusing more on extractive summaries,\ntrying to achieve more coherent and meaningful summaries. During\na decade, several extractive approaches have been developed for\nautomatic summary generation that implements a number of machine\nlearning and optimization techniques. This paper presents a\ncomprehensive survey of recent text summarization extractive\napproaches developed in the last decade. Their needs are\nidentified and their advantages and disadvantages are listed in a\ncomparative manner. A few abstractive and multilingual text\nsummarization approaches are also covered. Summary evaluation is\nanother challenging issue in this research field. Therefore,\nintrinsic as well as extrinsic both the methods of summary\nevaluation are described in detail along with text summarization\nevaluation conferences and workshops. Furthermore, evaluation\nresults of extractive summarization approaches are presented on\nsome shared DUC datasets.

In an ethnographic study, Gabbay and Le May showed\nthat clinicians in everyday practice situations do not\nexplicitly or consciously use guidelines. Instead, they use\nmindlines: collectively shared, mostly tacit knowledge that is\nshaped by many sources, including accumulated personal\nexperiences, education (formal and informal), guidance, and\nthe narratives about patients that are shared among\ncolleagues. In this study on informal knowledge, we consider\nvirtual networks of clinicians as representative of the\nmindlines in the wider medical community, as holders of\nknowledge, as well as catalysts of knowing. OBJECTIVE: The aim\nof this study was to explore how informal knowledge and its\ncreation in communities of clinicians can be characterized as\nopposed to the more structured knowledge produced in guideline\ndevelopment. METHODS: This study included a qualitative study\nof postings on three large virtual networks for physicians in\nthe United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and Norway, taking the\ntopic of statins as a case study and covering more than 1400\nposts. Data were analyzed thematically with reference to\ntheories of collaborative knowledge construction and\ncommunities of practice. RESULTS: The dataset showed very few\npostings referring to, or seeking to adhere to, explicit\nguidance and recommendations. Participants presented many\ninstances of individual case narratives that highlighted\nquantitative test results and clinical examination findings.\nThere was an emphasis on outliers and the material,\nregulatory, and practical constraints on knowledge use by\nclinicians. Participants conveyed not-so-explicit knowledge as\ntacit and practical knowledge and used a prevailing style of\npragmatic reasoning focusing on what was likely to work in a\nparticular case. Throughout the discussions, a collective\nconceptualization of statins was generated and reinforced in\nmany contexts through stories, jokes, and imagery.\nCONCLUSIONS: Informal knowledge and knowing in clinical\ncommunities entail an inherently collective dynamic practice\nthat includes explicit and nonexplicit components. It can be\ncharacterized as knowledge-in-context in practice, with a\nstrong focus on casuistry. Validity of knowledge appears not\nto be based on criteria of consensus, coherence, or\ncorrespondence but on a more polyphonic understanding of\ntruth. We contend that our findings give enough ground for\nfurther research on how exploring mindlines of clinicians\nonline could help improve guideline development processes.\",\njournal     = \"Journal of medical Internet research\",\nvolume      =  20,\nnumber      =  2,\npages       = \"e34\",\nmonth       =  \"2~\" # feb,\nyear        =  2018,\nurl         = \"http://dx.doi.org/10.2196/jmir.8325\",\nfile        = \"All Papers/W/Wieringa et al. 2018 - How Knowledge Is Constructed and Exchanged in Virtual Communities of Physicians - Qualitative Study of Mindlines Online.pdf\",\nkeywords    = \"evidence-based medicine; evidence-based practice; guidelines\nas topic; knowledge management; translational medical\nresearch;2019 Birth Stories\",\nlanguage    = \"en\",\nissn        = \"1439-4456, 1438-8871\",\npmid        = \"29396385\",\ndoi         = \"10.2196/jmir.8325\",\npmc         = \"PMC5882224\"\n}\n\n@ARTICLE{Ouyang_undated-sb,\ntitle    = \"{Towards Automatic Detection of Narrative Structure}\",\nauthor   = \"Ouyang, Jessica and Mc Keown, Kathleen\",\nurl      = \"https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/56f7/643d036cba3917e294504f4945a20e9e4af9.pdf\",\nfile     = \"All Papers/O/Ouyang and Mc Keown - Towards Automatic Detection of Narrative Structure.pdf\",\nkeywords = \"narrative;Narrative\"\n}\n\n@ARTICLE{Rahimtoroghi2017-wi,\ntitle         = \"{Modelling Protagonist Goals and Desires in First-Person\nNarrative}\",\nauthor        = \"Rahimtoroghi, Elahe and Wu, Jiaqi and Wang, Ruimin and\nAnand, Pranav and Walker, Marilyn A\",\nabstract      = \"Many genres of natural language text are narratively\nstructured, a testament to our predilection for organizing\nour experiences as narratives.

To bridge this gap, we use\nsequence learning with recurrent neural networks and semantic\nrepresentation of one- or multi-word expressions: we develop\nend-to-end architectures directly tailored to the task,\nincluding bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory, Gated\nRecurrent Units with an attention mechanism, and additional\nsemantic similarity features based on UMLS. Our evaluation\nagainst a standard benchmark shows that recurrent neural\nnetworks improve results over an effective baseline for\nclassification based on convolutional neural networks. A\nqualitative examination of mentions discovered in a dataset of\nuser reviews collected from popular online health information\nplatforms as well as a quantitative evaluation both show\nimprovements in the semantic representation of health-related\nexpressions in social media.\",\njournal     = \"Journal of biomedical informatics\",\nmonth       =  \"12~\" # jun,\nyear        =  2018,\nurl         = \"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jbi.2018.06.006\",\nfile        = \"All Papers/T/Tutubalina et al. 2018 - Medical Concept Normalization in Social Media Posts with Recurrent Neural Networks.pdf\",\nkeywords    = \"Information extraction; Medical concept normalization; Natural\nlanguage processing; Recurrent neural networks; Social media;\nUser reviews;medical;Synonym Discovery;2018 MSR;Named Entities\",\nlanguage    = \"en\",\nissn        = \"1532-0464, 1532-0480\",\npmid        = \"29906585\",\ndoi         = \"10.1016/j.jbi.2018.06.006\"\n}\n\n@ARTICLE{Chambers2008-hw,\ntitle    = \"{Unsupervised learning of narrative event chains}\",\nauthor   = \"Chambers, Nathanael and Jurafsky, Dan\",\njournal  = \"Proceedings of ACL-08: HLT\",\npages    = \"789--797\",\nyear     =  2008,\nurl      = \"http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P08-1090\",\nfile     = \"All Papers/C/Chambers and Jurafsky 2008 - Unsupervised learning of narrative event chains.pdf\",\nkeywords = \"narrative;Narrative\"\n}\n\n@INPROCEEDINGS{Asuncion2009-ew,\ntitle     = \"{On Smoothing and Inference for Topic Models}\",\nbooktitle = \"{Proceedings of the Twenty-Fifth Conference on Uncertainty in\nArtificial Intelligence}\",\nauthor    = \"Asuncion, Arthur and Welling, Max and Smyth, Padhraic and Teh,\nYee Whye\",\npublisher = \"AUAI Press\",\npages     = \"27--34\",\nseries    = \"UAI '09\",\nyear      =  2009,\nurl       = \"http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1795114.1795118\",\nfile      = \"All Papers/A/Asuncion et al. 2009 - On Smoothing and Inference for Topic Models.pdf\",\naddress   = \"Arlington, Virginia, United States\",\nkeywords  = \"Topic Modeling\",\nlocation  = \"Montreal, Quebec, Canada\",\nisbn      = \"9780974903958\"\n}\n\n@PHDTHESIS{Chotimongkol2008-yj,\ntitle    = \"{Learning the structure of task-oriented conversations from the\ncorpus of in-domain dialogs}\",\nauthor   = \"Chotimongkol, Ananlada\",\nyear     =  2008,\nurl      = \"https://www.lti.cs.cmu.edu/sites/default/files/research/thesis/2008/ananlada_chotimongkol_learning_the_structure_of_task-oriented_conversations_from_the_corpus_of_in-domain_dialogs.pdf\",\nfile     = \"All Papers/C/Chotimongkol 2008 - Learning the structure of task-oriented conversations from the corpus of in-domain dialogs.pdf\",\nschool   = \"Carnegie Mellon University, Language Technologies Institute,\nSchool of Computer Science\",\nkeywords = \"narrative;summarization;unsupervised;Narrative;Summarization\n(Unsupervised)\"\n}\n\n@ARTICLE{Griffiths2004-dm,\ntitle       = \"{Finding scientific topics}\",\nauthor      = \"Griffiths, Thomas L and Steyvers, Mark\",\naffiliation = \"Department of Psychology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA\n94305, USA. gruffydd@psych.stanford.edu\",\nabstract    = \"A first step in identifying the content of a document is\ndetermining which topics that document addresses.

The main focus is on two-way\nbilinear data analysis, but the results can easily be generalized\nto multiway data analysis. In fact, one of the scopes of this\npaper is to show that if two-way centering and scaling are\nunderstood, then multiway centering and scaling is quite\nstraightforward. In the literature it is often stated that\npreprocessing of multiway arrays is difficult, but here it is\nshown that most of the difficulties do not pertain to three- and\nhigher-way modeling in particular. It is shown that centering is\nmost conveniently seen as a projection step, where the data are\nprojected onto certain well-defined spaces within a given mode.\nThis view of centering helps to explain why, for example,\ncentering data with missing elements is likely to be suboptimal\nif there are many missing elements. Building a model for data\nconsists of two parts: postulating a structural model and using a\nmethod to estimate the parameters. Centering has to do with the\nfirst part: when centering, a model including offsets is\npostulated. Scaling has to do with the second part: when scaling,\nanother way of fitting the model is employed. It is shown that\ncentering is simply a convenient technique to estimate model\nparameters for models with certain offsets, but this does not\nwork for all types of offsets. It is also shown that scaling is a\nway to fit models with a weighted least squares loss function and\nthat sometimes this change in objective function cannot be\nperformed by a simple scaling step. Further practical aspects of\nand alternatives to centering and scaling are discussed, and\nexamples are used throughout to show that the conclusions in the\npaper are not only of theoretical interest but can have an impact\non practical data analysis.

CONCLUSION: The reasons\nfor the reported increase in pregnancy-related mortality are\nunclear; possible factors include an increase in the risk of\nwomen dying, changed coding with the International\nClassification of Diseases, 10th Revision, and the addition by\nstates of pregnancy checkboxes to the death certificate.\nState-based maternal death reviews and maternal quality\ncollaboratives have the potential to identify deaths, review\nthe factors associated with them, and take action on the\nfindings.\",\njournal     = \"Obstetrics and gynecology\",\nvolume      =  116,\nnumber      =  6,\npages       = \"1302--1309\",\nmonth       =  dec,\nyear        =  2010,\nurl         = \"http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/AOG.0b013e3181fdfb11\",\nfile        = \"All Papers/B/Berg et al. 2010 - Pregnancy-related mortality in the United States, 1998 to 2005.pdf\",\nkeywords    = \"pregnancy;healthcare;reproductive-healthcare\",\nlanguage    = \"en\",\nissn        = \"0029-7844, 1873-233X\",\npmid        = \"21099595\",\ndoi         = \"10.1097/AOG.0b013e3181fdfb11\"\n}\n\n@ARTICLE{Hashimoto2016-oq,\ntitle    = \"{Adaptive Joint Learning of Compositional and Non-Compositional\nPhrase Embeddings}\",\nauthor   = \"Hashimoto, Kazuma and Tsuruoka, Yoshimasa\",\nabstract = \"We present a novel method for jointly learning compositional and\nnoncompositional phrase embeddings by adaptively weighting both\ntypes of embeddings using a compositionality scoring function.\nThe scoring function is used to quantify the level of\ncompositionality of each phrase, and the parameters of the\nfunction are jointly optimized with the objective for learning\nphrase embeddings.

In this paper we propose supervised and\nunsupervised approaches, based on word embeddings, to identifying\ntoken instances of VNICs. Our proposed supervised and\nunsupervised approaches perform better than the supervised and\nunsupervised approaches of Fazly et al. (2009), respectively. 1\nVerb--noun Idiomatic Combinations Much research on multiword\nexpressions (MWEs) in natural language processing (NLP) has\nfocused on various type-level prediction tasks, e.g., MWE\nextraction (e.g., Church and Hanks, 1990; Smadja, 1993; Lin,\n1999) --- i.e., determining which MWE types are present in a\ngiven corpus (Baldwin and Kim, 2010) --- and compositionality\nprediction (e.g., McCarthy et al., 2003; Reddy et al., 2011;\nSalehi et al., 2014). However, word combinations can be ambiguous\nbetween literal combinations and MWEs. For example, consider the\nfollowing two usages of the expression hit the roof : 1. I think\nPaula might hit the roof if you start ironing. 2. When the blood\nhit the roof of the car I realised it was serious. The first\nexample of hit the roof is an idiomatic usage, while the second\nis a literal combination.1 MWE identification is the task of\ndetermining These examples, and idiomaticity judgements, are\ntaken from Cook et al. (2008). which token instances in running\ntext are MWEs (Baldwin and Kim, 2010). Although there has been\nrelatively less work on MWE identification than other type-level\nMWE prediction tasks, it is nevertheless important for NLP\napplications such as machine translation that must be able to\ndistinguish MWEs from literal combinations in context. Some\nrecent work has focused on token-level identification of a wide\nrange of types of MWEs and other multiword units (e.g., Newman et\nal., 2012; Schneider et al., 2014; Brooke et al., 2014). Many\nstudies, however, have taken a word sense\ndisambiguation--inspired approach to MWE identification (e.g.,\nBirke and Sarkar, 2006; Katz and Giesbrecht, 2006; Li et al.,\n2010), treating literal combinations and MWEs as different word\nsenses, and have exploited linguistic knowledge of MWEs (e.g.,\nPatrick and Fletcher, 2005; Uchiyama et al., 2005; Hashimoto and\nKawahara, 2008; Fazly et al., 2009; Fothergill and Baldwin,\n2012). In this study we focus on English verb--noun idiomatic\ncombinations (VNICs). VNICs are formed from a verb with a noun in\nits direct object position. They are a common and productive type\nof English idiom, and occur cross-lingually (Fazly et al., 2009).\nVNICs tend to be relatively lexico-syntactically fixed, e.g.,\nwhereas hit the roof is ambiguous between literal and idiomatic\nmeanings, hit the roofs and a roof was hit are most likely to be\nliteral usages. Fazly et al. (2009) exploit this property in\ntheir unsupervised approach, referred to as CFORM. They define\nlexico-syntactic patterns for VNIC token instances based on the\nnoun's determiner (e.g., a, the, or possibly no determiner), the\nnumber of the noun (singular or plural), and the verb's voice\n(active or passive). They propose a statistical method for\nautomatically determining a given VNIC type's canonical idiomatic\nform, based on the frequency of its usage in these\",\njournal  = \"MWE@ACL\",\nyear     =  2016,\nurl      = \"https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/5e9d/9ccfe0a1ef4af8486559d1686bd50181eca4.pdf\",\nfile     = \"All Papers/G/Gharbieh et al. 2016 - A Word Embedding Approach to Identifying Verb-Noun Idiomatic Combinations.pdf\",\nkeywords = \"compositionality;2016 Uncanny / Anomaly\"\n}\n\n@ARTICLE{Cordeiro2016-lz,\ntitle    = \"{Predicting the Compositionality of Nominal Compounds: Giving Word\nEmbeddings a Hard Time}\",\nauthor   = \"Cordeiro, Silvio and Ramisch, Carlos and Idiart, Marco and\nVillavicencio, Aline\",\nabstract = \"Distributional semantic models (DSMs) are often evaluated on\nartificial similarity datasets containing single words or fully\ncompositional phrases.

The second part, ``Animal Meditations,'' pursues\nconsequences of this hypothesis with regard to the disparaged\nbut enduring project of metaphysics, with its emphasis on\ncategories such as reality, humanness, and the soul.\",\npublisher = \"University of Minnesota Press\",\nyear      =  2015,\nurl       = \"http://minnesota.universitypressscholarship.com/10.5749/minnesota/9780816694808.001.0001/upso-9780816694808\",\nfile      = \"All Papers/D/Dubreuil 2015 - The Intellective Space - Thinking beyond Cognition.pdf\",\nkeywords  = \"Cognition;

Social\nnorms, information values, information behaviours, activities,\norganizations, and most notably community boundaries all have\nimportant sociotechnical impacts (Jaeger \\& Burnett, 2010; Meyer,\n2014; Sawyer \\& Jarrahi, 2014; Star \\& Griesemer, 1989),\nespecially when an online community is centred on information.\nWhen digital libraries take on social aspects, akin to other\ninformation-centric online communities, how they are used and the\nroles they play for users within and across the boundaries of\nsocial spaces require exploration and understanding (Lynch, 2005;\nMarshall \\& Bly, 2004; Star, Bowker, \\& Neumann, 2003; Van House,\n2003). They may act as boundary objects (Star \\& Griesemer,\n1989), facilitating the establishment of norms, values, and\nbehaviours between communities, or the emergence of new\ncommunities around their use (Star et al., 2003). However, our\nunderstanding is limited of how a social digital library and\ninformation-centric online community may act as a boundary object\nand whether it supports this establishment and emergence. A\nsignificant research gap exists in our understanding of the\nsystems, environments, and contexts at play around a social\ndigital library as a boundary object. This paper presents a\nmixed-methods study of LibraryThing (librarything.com) and\nGoodreads (goodreads.com), which share characteristics of both\ninformation-centric communities and social digital libraries. The\nstudy's objective was to examine the information values and\ninformation behaviour of users; the boundaries and boundary\nobjects at play; and the roles these sites play for users, as\nboundary objects themselves. Research questions asked about these\nroles and how they may or may not facilitate the processes of\ntranslation, coherence, and convergence---taken from boundary\nobject theory (Star \\& Griesemer, 1989; Star et al., 2003)---\nbetween existing and of emergent communities around LibraryThing\nand Goodreads. Findings from qualitative and quantitative\nmethods---including content analysis, a survey, and\nsemistructured interviews---show these two sites play three key\nroles for users, with translation an important activity. Clear\nimplications exist for design and practice in digital libraries\nand online communities, and for research on and theorizing of\nboundaries and boundary objects in such contexts. This paper\nbegins by reviewing relevant literature on online communities,\nsocial digital libraries, and boundaries and boundary objects,\nwith an eye to the unexplored overlaps between them.

In fact, there are vanishingly few universals of\nlanguage in the direct sense that all languages exhibit them.\nInstead, diversity can be found at almost every level of\nlinguistic organization. This fundamentally changes the object\nof enquiry from a cognitive science perspective. This target\narticle summarizes decades of cross-linguistic work by\ntypologists and descriptive linguists, showing just how few\nand unprofound the universal characteristics of language are,\nonce we honestly confront the diversity offered to us by the\nworld's 6,000 to 8,000 languages. After surveying the various\nuses of ``universal,'' we illustrate the ways languages vary\nradically in sound, meaning, and syntactic organization, and\nthen we examine in more detail the core grammatical machinery\nof recursion, constituency, and grammatical relations.\nAlthough there are significant recurrent patterns in\norganization, these are better explained as stable engineering\nsolutions satisfying multiple design constraints, reflecting\nboth cultural-historical factors and the constraints of human\ncognition. Linguistic diversity then becomes the crucial datum\nfor cognitive science: we are the only species with a\ncommunication system that is fundamentally variable at all\nlevels.

Both optimization problems\nare formulated as an integer linear program (ILP) and solved\nusing public domain software. We analyze and discuss the\nperformance of both approaches using various evaluation setups on\ntwo well studied meeting corpora.

However, as a variety\nofresearchers have noted, guidelines for ethicalresearch on human\nsubjects written before theInternet's growth can be difficult to\nextend toresearch on Internet users.In this paper, I focus on one\nethicalissue: whether and to what extent to disguisematerial\ncollected online in publishedaccounts. While some people argue\nthatvulnerable human subjects must always be madeanonymous in\npublications for their ownprotection, others argue that Internet\nusersdeserve credit for their creative andintellectual work.\nStill others argue thatmuch material available online should\nbetreated as ``published.''

A useful alternatemental\nmodel is proposed: Internet users areamateur artists. The\nInternet can be seen as aplayground for amateur artists\ncreatingsemi-published work.

What has not\nbeen reported is the effect that birth stories may have on\nprimigravid women's understandings of birth. Findings are\npresented from a qualitative study exploring how two\ngenerations of women came to understand birth in the milieu of\nother's stories. The prior assumption was that birth stories\nmust surely have a positive or negative influence on\nlisteners, steering them towards either medical or\nmidwifery-led models of care. METHODS: A Heideggerian\nhermeneutic phenomenological approach was used. Twenty UK\nparticipants were purposively selected and interviewed.\nFindings from the initial sample of 10 women who were pregnant\nin 2012 indicated that virtual media was a primary source of\nbirth stories. This led to recruitment of a second sample of\n10 women who gave birth in the 1970s-1980s, to determine\nwhether they were more able to translate information into\nknowledge via stories told through personal contact and not\nthrough virtual technologies. RESULTS: Findings revealed the\nexperience of 'being-in-the-world' of birth and of stories in\nthat world. From a Heideggerian perspective, the birth story\nwas constructed through 'idle talk' (the taken for granted\nassumptions of things, which come into being through\nlanguage). Both oral stories and those told through technology\nwere described as the 'modern birth story'. The first theme\n'Stories are difficult like that', examines the birth story as\nproblematic and considers how stories shape meaning. The\nsecond 'It's a generational thing', considers how women from\ntwo generations came to understand what their experience might\nbe. The third 'Birth in the twilight of certainty,' examines\nwomen's experience of Being in a system of birth as\nconstructed, portrayed and sustained in the stories being\nshared. CONCLUSIONS: The women pregnant in 2012 framed their\nexpectations in the language of choice, whilst the women who\nbirthed in the 1970s-1980s framed their experience in the\nlanguage of safety. For both, however, the world of birth was\nthe same; saturated with, and only legitimised by the birth of\na healthy baby.

Medical\nprofessionals who use social networking sites have unique\nresponsibilities since their postings could violate patient\nprivacy. However, it is unknown whether students and residents\nportray protected health information and under what\ncircumstances or contexts. OBJECTIVE: The objective of our\nstudy was to document and describe online portrayals of\npotential patient privacy violations in the Facebook profiles\nof medical students and residents. METHODS: A\nmultidisciplinary team performed two cross-sectional analyses\nat the University of Florida in 2007 and 2009 of all medical\nstudents and residents to see who had Facebook profiles. For\neach identified profile, we manually scanned the entire\nprofile for any textual or photographic representations of\nprotected health information, such as portrayals of people,\nnames, dates, or descriptions of procedures. RESULTS: Almost\nhalf of all eligible students and residents had Facebook\nprofiles (49.8\\%, or n=1023 out of 2053). There were 12\ninstances of potential patient violations, in which students\nand residents posted photographs of care they provided to\nindividuals. No resident or student posted any identifiable\npatient information or likeness in text form. Each instance\noccurred in developing countries on apparent medical mission\ntrips. These portrayals increased over time (1 in the 2007\ncohort; 11 in 2009; P = .03). Medical students were more\nlikely to have these potential violations on their profiles\nthan residents (11 vs 1, P = .04), and there was no difference\nby gender. Photographs included trainees interacting with\nidentifiable patients, all children, or performing medical\nexaminations or procedures such as vaccinations of children.\nCONCLUSIONS: While students and residents in this study are\nposting photographs that are potentially violations of patient\nprivacy, they only seem to make this lapse in the setting of\nmedical mission trips. Trainees need to learn to equate\nstandards of patient privacy in all medical contexts using\nboth legal and ethical arguments to maintain the highest\nprofessional principles. We propose three practical\nguidelines. First, there should be a legal resource for\nphysicians traveling on medical mission trips such as an\nonline list of local laws, or a telephone legal contact.\nSecond, institutions that organize medical mission trips\nshould plan an ethics seminar prior the departure on any trip\nsince the legal and ethical implications may not be intuitive.\nFinally, at minimum, traveling physicians should apply the\nstrictest legal precedent to any situation.\",\njournal     = \"Journal of medical Internet research\",\nvolume      =  13,\nnumber      =  1,\npages       = \"e8\",\nmonth       =  \"19~\" # jan,\nyear        =  2011,\nurl         = \"http://dx.doi.org/10.2196/jmir.1590\",\nfile        = \"All Papers/T/Thompson et al. 2011 - Protected health information on social networking sites - ethical and legal considerations.pdf\",\nkeywords    = \"medical;ethics;data-ethics;2019 Birth Stories\",\nlanguage    = \"en\",\nissn        = \"1439-4456, 1438-8871\",\npmid        = \"21247862\",\ndoi         = \"10.2196/jmir.1590\",\npmc         = \"PMC3221358\"\n}\n\n@ARTICLE{Vayena2015-tc,\ntitle       = \"{Ethical challenges of big data in public health}\",\nauthor      = \"Vayena, Effy and Salath{\\'e}, Marcel and Madoff, Lawrence C\nand Brownstein, John S\",\naffiliation = \"Institute of Biomedical Ethics, University of Zurich, Zurich,\nSwitzerland.

Narrative structure is an anvil for forging new\nartificial intelligence and machine learning techniques, and is\na window into abstraction and conceptual learning as well as\ninto culture and its in influence on cognition. I advance our\nunderstanding of narrative structure by describing Analogical\nStory Merging (ASM), a new machine learning algorithm that can\nextract culturally-relevant plot patterns from sets of\nfolktales. I demonstrate that ASM can learn a substantive\nportion of Vladimir Propp's in influential theory of the\nstructure of folktale plots. The challenge was to take\ndescriptions at one semantic level, namely, an event timeline as\ndescribed in folktales, and abstract to the next higher level:\nstructures such as Villainy, Stuggle- Victory, and Reward. ASM\nis based on Bayesian Model Merging, a technique for learning\nregular grammars. I demonstrate that, despite ASM's large search\nspace, a carefully-tuned prior allows the algorithm to converge,\nand furthermore it reproduces Propp's categories with a\nchance-adjusted Rand index of 0.511 to 0.714. Three important\ncategories are identied with F-measures above 0.8. The data are\n15 Russian folktales, comprising 18,862 words, a subset of\nPropp's original tales. This subset was annotated for 18 aspects\nof meaning by 12 annotators using the Story Workbench, a general\ntext-annotation tool I developed for this work. Each aspect was\ndoubly-annotated and adjudicated at inter-annotator F-measures\nthat cluster around 0.7 to 0.8. It is the largest, most\ndeeply-annotated narrative corpus assembled to date. The work\nhas significance far beyond folktales.

This study\nsought to describe demographics, usage patterns, and perceived\nbenefits for women participating in Internet pregnancy loss\nsupport groups. METHODS: We requested permission to post an\nanonymous Internet survey on large and active United States\nInternet message boards for women with miscarriages and\nstillbirths. The study purposefully oversampled stillbirth\nsites and included both closed- and open-ended questions. The\nUniversity of Michigan Institutional Review Board approved the\nstudy. Closed-ended questions were summarized and evaluated\nwith bivariate analysis. We performed a qualitative analysis\nof open-ended data using an iterative coding process to\nidentify key themes. RESULTS: Of 62 sites queried, 15 granted\npermission to post the survey on 18 different message boards.\nWe collected 1,039 surveys, of which 1,006 were complete and\neligible for analysis. Women were typically white, well\neducated, and frequent users. They noted message boards helped\nthem to feel less isolated in their loss and grief and they\nappreciated unique aspects of Internet communication such as\nconvenience, access, anonymity, and privacy. Pregnancy loss\nmessage boards are an important aspect of support for many\nbereaved mothers. African-American women seem to be\nsubstantially underrepresented on-line despite being at higher\nrisk for stillbirth. CONCLUSION: Internet message boards serve\na unique function in providing support for women with\nmiscarriage and stillbirth. The benefits are often\nsignificantly different from those encountered in traditional\nface-to-face bereavement support.\",\njournal     = \"Women's health issues: official publication of the Jacobs\nInstitute of Women's Health\",\nvolume      =  22,\nnumber      =  1,\npages       = \"e67--72\",\nmonth       =  jan,\nyear        =  2012,\nurl         = \"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.whi.2011.07.006\",\nfile        = \"All Papers/G/Gold et al. 2012 - Internet message boards for pregnancy loss - who's on-line and why.pdf\",\nkeywords    = \"pregnancy;reproductive-healthcare;2019 Birth Stories\",\nlanguage    = \"en\",\nissn        = \"1049-3867, 1878-4321\",\npmid        = \"21907592\",\ndoi         = \"10.1016/j.whi.2011.07.006\",\npmc         = \"PMC3237941\"\n}\n\n@ARTICLE{Layne2003-xq,\ntitle       = \"{Unhappy endings: a feminist reappraisal of the women's health\nmovement from the vantage of pregnancy loss}\",\nauthor      = \"Layne, Linda L\",\naffiliation = \"Department of Science and Technology Studies, Rensselaer\nPolytechnic Institute, Troy, New York 12180, USA.\nlaynel@rpi.edu\",\nabstract    = \"This essay contrasts the rosy birth scenarios of the natural\nchildbirth movement with reproductive disaster stories of\nmembers of pregnancy loss support groups and women from\ntoxically assaulted communities in the US who have suffered\npregnancy loss.

Members of OHCs interact online with similar peers\nto seek, receive, and provide different types of social\nsupport, such as informational support, emotional support, and\ncompanionship. As active participations in an OHC are\nbeneficial to both the OHC and its users, it is important to\nunderstand factors related to users' participations and\npredict user churn for user retention efforts. OBJECTIVE: This\nstudy aimed to analyze OHC users' Web-based interactions,\nreveal which types of social support activities are related to\nusers' participation, and predict whether and when a user will\nchurn from the OHC. METHODS: We collected a large-scale\ndataset from a popular OHC for cancer survivors. We used text\nmining techniques to decide what kinds of social support each\npost contained. We illustrated how we built text classifiers\nfor 5 different social support categories: seeking\ninformational support (SIS), providing informational support\n(PIS), seeking emotional support (SES), providing emotional\nsupport (PES), and companionship (COM). We conducted survival\nanalysis to identify types of social support related to users'\ncontinued participation. Using supervised machine learning\nmethods, we developed a predictive model for user churn.\nRESULTS: Users' behaviors to PIS, SES, and COM had hazard\nratios significantly lower than 1 (0.948, 0.972, and 0.919,\nrespectively) and were indicative of continued participations\nin the OHC. The churn prediction model based on social support\nactivities offers accurate predictions on whether and when a\nuser will leave the OHC. CONCLUSIONS: Detecting different\ntypes of social support activities via text mining contributes\nto better understanding and prediction of users'\nparticipations in an OHC. The outcome of this study can help\nthe management and design of a sustainable OHC via more\nproactive and effective user retention strategies.\",\njournal     = \"Journal of medical Internet research\",\nvolume      =  19,\nnumber      =  4,\npages       = \"e130\",\nmonth       =  \"24~\" # apr,\nyear        =  2017,\nurl         = \"http://dx.doi.org/10.2196/jmir.6834\",\nfile        = \"All Papers/W/Wang et al. 2017 - Analyzing and Predicting User Participations in Online Health Communities - A Social Support Perspective.pdf\",\nkeywords    = \"community networks; machine learning; patient engagement;\nprediction; social\nsupport;online-health-communities;roles-in-online-communities\",\nlanguage    = \"en\",\nissn        = \"1439-4456, 1438-8871\",\npmid        = \"28438725\",\ndoi         = \"10.2196/jmir.6834\",\npmc         = \"PMC5422656\"\n}\n\n@ARTICLE{Yang_undated-uj,\ntitle    = \"{Thesis: Identify, Recommend and Configure Emergent Social Roles\nin Online Communities}\",\nauthor   = \"Yang, Diyi\",\nurl      = \"https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/b491/b54fefb01e23c57c9470b702e4e5da98c704.pdf\",\nfile     = \"All Papers/Y/Yang - Thesis - Identify, Recommend and Configure Emergent Social Roles in Online Communities.pdf\",\nkeywords = \"online-health-communities;roles-in-online-communities;main-papers-for-ohc-roles\"\n}\n\n@INPROCEEDINGS{Shang2019-gn,\ntitle     = \"{Users' Participation Motivation and Behavior Patterns in Online\nHealth Community: A Game Theory Viewpoint}\",\nbooktitle = \"{Proceedings of the 52nd Hawaii International Conference on\nSystem Sciences}\",\nauthor    = \"Shang, Yanyan\",\nyear      =  2019,\nurl       = \"https://scholarspace.manoa.hawaii.edu/bitstream/10125/59672/1/0232.pdf\",\nfile      = \"All Papers/S/Shang 2019 - Users' Participation Motivation and Behavior Patterns in Online Health Community - A Game Theory Viewpoint.pdf\",\nkeywords  = \"online-health-communities;roles-in-online-communities\"\n}\n\n@INPROCEEDINGS{Vlahovic2014-ti,\ntitle     = \"{Support matching and satisfaction in an online breast cancer\nsupport community}\",\nbooktitle = \"{Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in\nComputing Systems}\",\nauthor    = \"Vlahovic, Tatiana A and Wang, Yi-Chia and Kraut, Robert E and\nLevine, John M\",\npublisher = \"ACM\",\npages     = \"1625--1634\",\nmonth     =  \"26~\" # apr,\nyear      =  2014,\nurl       = \"https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=2556288.2557108\",\nfile      = \"All Papers/V/Vlahovic et al. 2014 - Support matching and satisfaction in an online breast cancer support community.pdf\",\nkeywords  = \"breast cancer; computer-mediated communication; health\ninformatics; social support; support groups; breast cancer;\ncomputer-mediated communication; health informatics; social\nsupport; support\ngroups;online-health-communities;roles-in-online-communities\",\nisbn      = \"9781450324731\",\ndoi       = \"10.1145/2556288.2557108\"\n}\n\n@ARTICLE{Zhang2018-wh,\ntitle    = \"{Online Support Groups for Depression in China: Culturally Shaped\nInteractions and Motivations}\",\nauthor   = \"Zhang, Renwen and Eschler, Jordan and Reddy, Madhu\",\nabstract = \"Online support groups have drawn considerable attention from\nscholars in the past decades.

Online communities for people with long-term\nconditions have the potential to influence health, usage of\nhealth care resources, and facilitate illness self-management.\nOnly recently, however, has evidence been reported on how such\ncommunities function and evolve, and how they support\nself-management of long-term conditions in practice.\nOBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to gain a better\nunderstanding of the mechanisms underlying online\nself-management support systems by analyzing the structure and\ndynamics of the networks connecting users who write posts over\ntime. METHODS: We conducted a longitudinal network analysis of\nanonymized data from 2 patients' online communities from the\nUnited Kingdom: the Asthma UK and the British Lung Foundation\n(BLF) communities in 2006-2016 and 2012-2016, respectively.\nRESULTS: The number of users and activity grew steadily over\ntime, reaching 3345 users and 32,780 posts in the Asthma UK\ncommunity, and 19,837 users and 875,151 posts in the BLF\ncommunity. People who wrote posts in the Asthma UK forum\ntended to write at an interval of 1-20 days and six months,\nwhile those in the BLF community wrote at an interval of two\ndays. In both communities, most pairs of users could reach one\nanother either directly or indirectly through other users.\nThose who wrote a disproportionally large number of posts (the\nsuperusers) represented 1\\% of the overall population of both\nAsthma UK and BLF communities and accounted for 32\\% and 49\\%\nof the posts, respectively. Sensitivity analysis showed that\nthe removal of superusers would cause the communities to\ncollapse. Thus, interactions were held together by very few\nsuperusers, who posted frequently and regularly, 65\\% of them\nat least every 1.7 days in the BLF community and 70\\% every\n3.1 days in the Asthma UK community. Their posting activity\nindirectly facilitated tie formation between other users.\nSuperusers were a constantly available resource, with a mean\nof 80 and 20 superusers active at any one time in the BLF and\nAsthma UK communities, respectively. Over time, the more\nactive users became, the more likely they were to reply to\nother users' posts rather than to write new ones, shifting\nfrom a help-seeking to a help-giving role. This might suggest\nthat superusers were more likely to provide than to seek\nadvice. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we uncover key structural\nproperties related to the way users interact and sustain\nonline health communities. Superusers' engagement plays a\nfundamental sustaining role and deserves research attention.\nFurther studies are needed to explore network determinants of\nthe effectiveness of online engagement concerning\nhealth-related outcomes. In resource-constrained health care\nsystems, scaling up online communities may offer a potentially\naccessible, wide-reaching and cost-effective intervention\nfacilitating greater levels of self-management.\",\njournal     = \"Journal of medical Internet research\",\nvolume      =  20,\nnumber      =  7,\npages       = \"e238\",\nmonth       =  \"11~\" # jul,\nyear        =  2018,\nurl         = \"http://dx.doi.org/10.2196/jmir.9952\",\nfile        = \"All Papers/J/Joglekar et al. 2018 - How Online Communities of People With Long-Term C ... amics of the Asthma UK and British Lung Foundation Online Communities.pdf\",\nkeywords    = \"COPD;

OBJECTIVE: The first goal was to\npropose and test a model of the dynamic process through which\nparticipants in online support communities elicit and provide\nemotional and informational support. The second was to\ndemonstrate the value of computer coding of conversational\ndata using machine learning techniques (1) by replicating\nresults derived from human-coded data about how people elicit\nsupport and (2) by answering questions that are intractable\nwith small samples of human-coded data, namely how exposure to\ndifferent types of social support predicts continued\nparticipation in online support communities. The third was to\nprovide a detailed description of these machine learning\ntechniques to enable other researchers to perform large-scale\ndata analysis in these communities. METHODS: Communication\namong approximately 90,000 registered users of an online\ncancer support community was analyzed. The corpus comprised\n1,562,459 messages organized into 68,158 discussion threads.\nAmazon Mechanical Turk workers coded (1) 1000 thread-starting\nmessages on 5 attributes (positive and negative emotional\nself-disclosure, positive and negative informational\nself-disclosure, questions) and (2) 1000 replies on emotional\nand informational support. Their judgments were used to train\nmachine learning models that automatically estimated the\namount of these 7 attributes in the messages. Across\nattributes, the average Pearson correlation between\nhuman-based judgments and computer-based judgments was .65.\nRESULTS: Part 1 used human-coded data to investigate\nrelationships between (1) 4 kinds of self-disclosure and\nquestion asking in thread-starting posts and (2) the amount of\nemotional and informational support in the first reply.\nSelf-disclosure about negative emotions (beta=.24, P<.001),\nnegative events (beta=.25, P<.001), and positive events\n(beta=.10, P=.02) increased emotional support. However, asking\nquestions depressed emotional support (beta=-.21, P<.001). In\ncontrast, asking questions increased informational support\n(beta=.38, P<.001), whereas positive informational\nself-disclosure depressed it (beta=-.09, P=.003).\nSelf-disclosure led to the perception of emotional needs,\nwhich elicited emotional support, whereas asking questions led\nto the perception of informational needs, which elicited\ninformational support. Part 2 used machine-coded data to\nreplicate these results. Part 3 analyzed the machine-coded\ndata and showed that exposure to more emotional support\npredicted staying in the group longer 33\\% (hazard ratio=0.67,\nP<.001), whereas exposure to more informational support\npredicted leaving the group sooner (hazard ratio=1.05,\nP<.001). CONCLUSIONS: Self-disclosure is effective in\neliciting emotional support, whereas question asking is\neffective in eliciting informational support. Moreover,\nperceptions that people desire particular kinds of support\ninfluence the support they receive. Finally, the type of\nsupport people receive affects the likelihood of their staying\nin or leaving the group. These results demonstrate the utility\nof machine learning methods for investigating the dynamics of\nsocial support exchange in online support communities.\",\njournal     = \"Journal of medical Internet research\",\nvolume      =  17,\nnumber      =  4,\npages       = \"e99\",\nmonth       =  \"20~\" # apr,\nyear        =  2015,\nurl         = \"http://dx.doi.org/10.2196/jmir.3558\",\nfile        = \"All Papers/W/Wang et al. 2015 - Eliciting and receiving online support - using computer-aided content analysis to examine the dynamics of online social support.pdf\",\nkeywords    = \"emotions; health communication; natural language processing;\nself-disclosure; social media; social support; support\ngroups;online-health-communities;conversation-types-in-online-communities;self-disclosure;roles-in-online-communities;2020\nMSR\",\nlanguage    = \"en\",\nissn        = \"1439-4456, 1438-8871\",\npmid        = \"25896033\",\ndoi         = \"10.2196/jmir.3558\",\npmc         = \"PMC4419194\"\n}\n\n@INPROCEEDINGS{Nakikj2017-mc,\ntitle     = \"{A Park or A Highway: Overcoming Tensions in Designing for\nSocio-emotional and Informational Needs in Online Health\nCommunities}\",\nbooktitle = \"{Proceedings of the 2017 ACM Conference on Computer Supported\nCooperative Work and Social Computing}\",\nauthor    = \"Nakikj, Drashko and Mamykina, Lena\",\npublisher = \"ACM\",\npages     = \"1304--1319\",\nmonth     =  \"25~\" # feb,\nyear      =  2017,\nurl       = \"https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=2998181.2998339\",\nfile      = \"All Papers/N/Nakikj and Mamykina 2017 - A Park or A Highway - Overcoming Tensions in ...

It is helpful for community\nmanagers in developing strategies for building community, for\norganizations in disseminating information about health\ninterventions, and for researchers in understanding the social\ndynamics of peer support. OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine if\nany patterns were apparent in the nature of user participation\nacross online health communities. METHODS: The current study\ninvolved a systematic review of all studies that have\ninvestigated the nature of participation in an online health\ncommunity and have provided a quantifiable method for\ncategorizing a person based on their participation style. A\nsystematic search yielded 20 papers. RESULTS: Participatory\nstyles were classified as either multidimensional (based on\nmultiple metrics) or unidimensional (based on one metric).\nWith respect to the multidimensional category, a total of 41\ndifferent participation styles were identified ranging from\nInfluential Users who were leaders on the board to\nTopic-Focused Responders who focused on a specific topic and\ntended to respond to rather than initiate posts. However,\nthere was little overlap in participation styles identified\nboth across OHCs for different health conditions and within\nOHCs for specific health conditions. Five of the 41 styles\nemerged in more than one study (Hubs, Authorities,\nFacilitators, Prime Givers, and Discussants), but the\nremainder were reported in only one study. The focus of the\nunidimensional studies was on level of engagement and\nparticularly on high-engaged users. Eight different metrics\nwere used to evaluate level of engagement with the greatest\nfocus on frequency of posts. CONCLUSIONS: With the exception\nof high-engaged users based on high post frequency, the\ncurrent review found little evidence for consistent\nparticipatory styles across different health communities.\nHowever, this area of research is in its infancy, with most of\nthe studies included in the review being published in the last\n2 years. Nevertheless, the review delivers a nomenclature for\nOHC participation styles and metrics and discusses important\nmethodological issues that will provide a basis for future\ncomparative research in the area. Further studies are required\nto systematically investigate a range of participatory styles,\nto investigate their association with different types of\nonline health communities and to determine the contribution of\ndifferent participatory styles within and across online health\ncommunities.\",\njournal     = \"Journal of medical Internet research\",\nvolume      =  17,\nnumber      =  12,\npages       = \"e271\",\nmonth       =  \"1~\" # dec,\nyear        =  2015,\nurl         = \"http://dx.doi.org/10.2196/jmir.4705\",\nfile        = \"All Papers/C/Carron-Arthur et al. 2015 - From Help-Seekers to Influential Users - A Systematic Review of Participation Styles in Online Health Communities.pdf\",\nkeywords    = \"online health community; participation inequality;\nparticipation style; social network; systematic\nreview;online-health-communities;roles-in-online-communities;main-papers-for-ohc-roles\",\nlanguage    = \"en\",\nissn        = \"1439-4456, 1438-8871\",\npmid        = \"26627369\",\ndoi         = \"10.2196/jmir.4705\",\npmc         = \"PMC4704975\"\n}\n\n% The entry below contains non-ASCII chars that could not be converted\n% to a LaTeX equivalent.\n@ARTICLE{Lundberg2018-vx,\ntitle         = \"{Privacy, ethics, and data access: A case study of the\nFragile Families Challenge}\",\nauthor        = \"Lundberg, Ian and Narayanan, Arvind and Levy, Karen and\nSalganik, Matthew J\",\nabstract      = \"Stewards of social science data face a fundamental tension.\nOn one hand, they want to make their data accessible to as\nmany researchers as possible to facilitate new discoveries.\nAt the same time, they want to restrict access to their data\nas much as possible in order to protect the people\nrepresented in the data.

Twitter is an immensely popular\nmicro-blogging network where people post short messages of 140\ncharacters called tweets. It has over 100 million active users\nwho post about 200 million tweets everyday. Phishers have started\nusing Twitter as a medium to spread phishing because of this vast\ninformation dissemination. Further, it is difficult to detect\nphishing on Twitter unlike emails because of the quick spread of\nphishing links in the network, short size of the content, and use\nof URL obfuscation to shorten the URL. Our technique, PhishAri,\ndetects phishing on Twitter in realtime. We use Twitter specific\nfeatures along with URL features to detect whether a tweet posted\nwith a URL is phishing or not. Some of the Twitter specific\nfeatures we use are tweet content and its characteristics like\nlength, hashtags, and mentions. Other Twitter features used are\nthe characteristics of the Twitter user posting the tweet such as\nage of the account, number of tweets, and the follower-followee\nratio. These twitter specific features coupled with URL based\nfeatures prove to be a strong mechanism to detect phishing\ntweets. We use machine learning classification techniques and\ndetect phishing tweets with an accuracy of 92.52\\%. We have\ndeployed our system for end-users by providing an easy to use\nChrome browser extension. The extension works in realtime and\nclassifies a tweet as phishing or safe. In this research, we show\nthat we are able to detect phishing tweets at zero hour with high\naccuracy which is much faster than public blacklists and as well\nas Twitter's own defense mechanism to detect malicious content.\nWe also performed a quick user evaluation of PhishAri in a\nlaboratory study to evaluate the usability and effectiveness of\nPhishAri and showed that users like and find it convenient to use\nPhishAri in real-world.

In\norder to determine this structure, one must understand how\ndifferent individual components of the overall argument are\nlinked. General consensus in this field dictates that the\nargument components form a hierarchy of persuasion, which\nmanifests itself in a tree structure. This work provides the\nfirst neural network-based approach to argumentation mining,\nfocusing on the two tasks of extracting links between argument\ncomponents, and classifying types of argument components. In\norder to solve this problem, we propose to use a joint model that\nis based on a Pointer Network architecture. A Pointer Network is\nappealing for this task for the following reasons: 1) It takes\ninto account the sequential nature of argument components; 2) By\nconstruction, it enforces certain properties of the tree\nstructure present in argument relations; 3) The hidden\nrepresentations can be applied to auxiliary tasks. In order to\nextend the contribution of the original Pointer Network model, we\nconstruct a joint model that simultaneously attempts to learn the\ntype of argument component, as well as continuing to predict\nlinks between argument components. The proposed joint model\nachieves state-of-the-art results on two separate evaluation\ncorpora, achieving far superior performance than a regular\nPointer Network model. Our results show that optimizing for both\ntasks, and adding a fully-connected layer prior to recurrent\nneural network input, is crucial for high performance.", "keywords": "Advanced Language Technology"}, {"title": "Should We Make Crime Impossible?", "authors": "Michael L Rich", "year": "", "ref_id": "Rich_undated-ua", "link": "", "abstract": "", "keywords": "Week 3"}, {"title": "Regulation By Contract, Regulation By Machine", "authors": "Margaret Jane Radin", "year": "2017", "ref_id": "Radin2017-gw", "link": "", "abstract": "", "keywords": "Week 3"}, {"title": "Where Are The Missing Masses?

Robots\nwill not replace humans, but rather work alongside and supplement\nhuman work. Even when most of a system will be automated, the\nconcept of keeping a ``human in the loop'' assures that human\njudgment will always be able to trump automation. This rhetoric\nemphasizes fluid cooperation and shared control. In practice, the\ndynamics of shared control between human and robot are more\ncomplicated, especially with respect to issues of\naccountability.As control has become distributed across multiple\nactors, our social and legal conceptions of responsibility remain\ngenerally about an individual. If there's an accident, we\nintuitively --- and our laws, in practice --- want someone to\ntake the blame. The result of this ambiguity is that humans may\nemerge as ``moral crumple zones.'' Just as the crumple zone in a\ncar is designed to absorb the force of impact in a crash, the\nhuman in a robotic system may become simply a component ---\naccidentally or intentionally --- that is intended to bear the\nbrunt of the moral and legal penalties when the overall system\nfails.This paper employs the concept of ``moral crumple zones''\nwithin human-machine systems as a lens through which to think\nabout the limitations of current frameworks for accountability in\nhuman-machine or robot systems. The paper examines two historical\ncases of ``moral crumple zones'' in the fields of aviation and\nnuclear energy and articulates the dimensions of distributed\ncontrol at stake while also mapping the degree to which this\ncontrol of and responsibility for an action are proportionate.\nThe argument suggests that an analysis of the dimensions of\naccountability in automated and robotic systems must contend with\nhow and why accountability may be misapplied and how structural\nconditions enable this misunderstanding. How do non-human actors\nin a system effectively deflect accountability onto other human\nactors? And how might future models of robotic accountability\nrequire this deflection to be controlled? At stake is the\npotential ultimately to protect against new forms of consumer and\nworker harm.This paper presents the concept of the ``moral\ncrumple zone'' as both a challenge to and an opportunity for the\ndesign and regulation of human-robot systems. By articulating\nmismatches between control and responsibility, we argue for an\nupdated framework of accountability in human-robot systems, one\nthat can contend with the complicated dimensions of cooperation\nbetween human and robot.", "keywords": "Automation; Autonomy; Ethics; HCI; HRI; driverless cars; human\nfactors; human in the loop;Week 6"}, {"title": "The Quest To Improve America's Financial Literacy Is Both A Failure And A Sham", "authors": "Helaine Olen", "year": "2014", "ref_id": "Olen2014-lg", "link": "", "abstract": "", "keywords": "Week 6"}, {"title": "Users As Agents Of Technological Change: The Social Construction Of The Automobile In The Rural United States", "authors": "Ronald Kline, Trevor Pinch", "year": "1996", "ref_id": "Kline1996-bs", "link": "", "abstract": "", "keywords": "Week 6"}, {"title": "Metaphor Detection Through Term Relevance", "authors": "Marc Schulder, Eduard Hovy", "year": "2014", "ref_id": "Schulder2014-lv", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.3115/v1/W14-2303", "abstract": "Most computational approaches to metaphor detection try to\nleverage either conceptual metaphor mappings or selec-tional\npreferences.

Methods An online survey was completed by\n410 women who were pregnant or had given birth to at least one\nchild in the past three years, were aged between 18 and 45 and\nwere competent in English. Findings The use of pregnancy and\nparenting apps was common among the respondents.

Little is known about how\npregnant women engage with technologies and the interface between\nthese tools and medical care, especially for women of lower\nsocioeconomic status. Objective: We sought to understand how\nwomen use technology during pregnancy through a qualitative study\nwith women enrolled in the Women, Infants, and Children (WIC)\nprogram. Methods: We recruited pregnant women ages 18 and older\nwho owned a smartphone, at a WIC clinic in central Pennsylvania.\nThe focus group guide included questions about women's current\npregnancy, their sources of information, and whether they used\ntechnology for pregnancy-related information. Sessions were\naudiotaped and transcribed. Three members of the research team\nindependently analyzed each transcript, using a thematic analysis\napproach. Themes related to the topics discussed were identified,\nfor which there was full agreement. Results: Four focus groups\nwere conducted with a total of 17 women. Three major themes\nemerged as follows. First, the prenatal visit structure is not\npatient-centered, with the first visit perceived as occurring too\nlate and with too few visits early in pregnancy when women have\nthe most questions for their prenatal care providers.\nUnfortunately, the educational materials women received during\nprenatal care were viewed as unhelpful. Second, women turn to\ntechnology (eg, Google, smartphone applications) to fill their\nknowledge gaps. Turning to technology was viewed to be a\ngenerational approach. Finally, women reported that technology,\nalthough frequently used, has limitations. Conclusions: The\nresults of this qualitative research suggest that the current\nprenatal care visit structure is not patient-centered in that it\ndoes not allow women to seek advice when they want it most. A\ngenerational shift seems to have occurred, resulting in pregnant\nwomen in our study turning to the Internet and smartphones to\nfill this gap, which requires significant skills to navigate for\nuseful information.

In Morphology of the\nFolktale, Vladimir Propp argues against the separation of ``who\nacts'' from ``the question of the actions themselves,'' instead\nadvocating an approach that studies characters according to their\nfunctions.1 Similarly, the notion of the literary archetype, as\ninfluenced by both Joseph Campbell and Carl Jung, highlights the\nway in which what characters do influences the way we perceive\nwho characters are.2 The notion of literary stereotypes is also\ntied to this discussion. As Bamman, O'Connor, and Smith observe\nin their study of personas in film, stereotypical characters are\n``defined by a fixed set of actions widely known to be\nrepresentative of a class.''3 While actions are only one part of\na complex network of descriptive tools that authors may use to\ncreate characters, 4 they may offer us a useful insight into the\nway that certain behaviors can align with various character\nidentity traits in literature. A study of character action may\nserve as a proxy to not only demarcate character types, but also\nto investigate what behaviors, and types of behaviors, were\nconventionally aligned with different groups of characters.\nBamman, Underwood, and Smith (2014) attempt something similar in\n``A Bayesian Mixed Effects Model of Literary Character.'' In that\nwork, the authors focus on modeling specific character\n``personas'' by studying semantically related words that occur in\nproximity to character mentions. The authors note that\n``articulating what a true 'persona' might be for characters is\ninherently problematic'' and they acknowledge that the ``personas\nlearned so far [by their model] do not align neatly with\ncharacter types known to literary historians.''5 Nevertheless,\ntheir study revealed compelling associations between certain\npersonas and certain genres and, more importantly for our current\nresearch, that certain personas were ``clearly gendered.'' 6 In\nnoting the later, the authors write that ``analysis of latent\ncharacter types might cast new light on the history of gender in\nfiction.''7 Our work attempts a more direct and specific study of\ncharacter agency in the context of character gender.

We give insight\ninto why averaging can still produce accurate meta-embedding\ndespite the incomparability of the source vector spaces.", "keywords": "combining-embeddings;2017 Combining Embeddings"}, {"title": "The Role Of Protected Class Word Lists In Bias Identification Of Contextualized Word Representations", "authors": "Jo\\~ao Sedoc, Lyle Ungar", "year": "2019", "ref_id": "Sedoc2019-yx", "link": "https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W19-3808", "abstract": "", "keywords": ""}, {"title": "A Systematic Literature Review Of User Trust In AI-Enabled Systems: An HCI Perspective", "authors": "Tita Alissa Bach, Amna Khan, Hallock  Harry And Beltr\\~ao  Gabriela, Sonia Sousa", "year": "2023", "ref_id": "Bach2023-kh", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08795", "abstract": "User trust in Artificial Intelligence (AI) enabled systems\nhas been increasingly recognized and proven as a key element\nto fostering adoption. It has been suggested that AI-enabled\nsystems must go beyond technical-centric approaches and\ntowards embracing a more human centric approach, a core\nprinciple of the human-computer interaction (HCI) field.\nThis review aims to provide an overview of the user trust\ndefinitions, influencing factors, and measurement methods\nfrom 23 empirical studies to gather insight for future\ntechnical and design strategies, research, and initiatives\nto calibrate the user AI relationship. The findings confirm\nthat there is more than one way to define trust. Selecting\nthe most appropriate trust definition to depict user trust\nin a specific context should be the focus instead of\ncomparing definitions. User trust in AI-enabled systems is\nfound to be influenced by three main themes, namely\nsocio-ethical considerations, technical and design features,\nand user characteristics. User characteristics dominate the\nfindings, reinforcing the importance of user involvement\nfrom development through to monitoring of AI enabled\nsystems. In conclusion, user trust needs to be addressed\ndirectly in every context where AI-enabled systems are being\nused or discussed. In addition, calibrating the user-AI\nrelationship requires finding the optimal balance that works\nfor not only the user but also the system.", "keywords": ""}, {"title": "Abusive Language Detection With Graph Convolutional Networks", "authors": "Pushkar Mishra, Marco Del Tredici, Helen Yannakoudakis, Ekaterina Shutova", "year": "2019", "ref_id": "Mishra2019-bo", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.04073", "abstract": "Abuse on the Internet represents a significant societal\nproblem of our time.
