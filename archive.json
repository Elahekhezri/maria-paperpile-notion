Due to the shortness of a\ntweet, a collective inference model incorporating global ev-\nidence from multiple mentions and con- cepts is more appropriate\nthan a non- collecitve approach which links each men- tion at a\ntime. In addition, it is chal- lenging to generate sufficient\nhigh quality labeled data for supervised models with low cost. To\ntackle these challenges, we propose a novel semi-supervised graph\nregularization model to incorporate both local and global\nevidence from multi- ple tweets through three fine-grained re-\nlations. In order to identify semantically- related mentions for\ncollective inference, we detect meta path-based semantic rela-\ntions through social networks. Compared to the state-of-the-art\nsupervised model trained from 100\\% labeled data, our pro- posed\napproach achieves comparable per- formance with 31\\% labeled data\nand ob- tains 5\\% absolute F1 gain with 50\\% la- beled data.", "author": "Huang, Hongzhao and Cao, Yunbo and Huang, Xiaojiang and Ji, Heng\nand Lin, Chin-Yew", "title": "{Collective Tweet Wikification based on Semi-supervised Graph\nRegularization}", "ENTRYTYPE": "article", "ID": "Huang2014-uf"}, {"keywords": "Week 7", "file": "All Papers/C/Cowan 1983 - More Work for Mother - The Ironies of Household Technology from the Open Hearth to the Microwave.pdf", "annote": "what about healthcare? is this an area where women still have to\ndo more work? e.g. birth control", "year": "1983", "author": "Cowan, Ruth Schwartz", "title": "{More Work for Mother: The Ironies of Household Technology from\nthe Open Hearth to the Microwave}", "ENTRYTYPE": "article", "ID": "Cowan1983-kb"}, {"issn": "2164-1757, 2164-3431", "keywords": "Week 5", "file": "All Papers/A/Allison et al. - Quantitative Formalism - an Experiment.pdf", "author": "Allison, Sarah and Heuser, Ryan and Jockers, Matthew and Moretti,\nFranco and Witmore, Michael", "title": "{Quantitative Formalism: an Experiment}", "ENTRYTYPE": "article", "ID": "Allison_undated-rw"}, {"file": "All Papers/H/Horsmann et al. 2015 - Fast or Accurate - \u2013 A Comparative Evaluation of PoS Tagging Models.pdf", "year": "2015", "number": "2009", "journal": "Proceedings of the International Conference of the German Society\nfor Computational Linguistics and Language Technology (GSCL-2015)", "author": "Horsmann, Tobias and Erbs, Nicolai and Zesch, Torsten", "title": "{Fast or Accurate ? -- A Comparative Evaluation of PoS Tagging\nModels}", "ENTRYTYPE": "article", "ID": "Horsmann2015-oy"}, {"keywords": "analytic thinking; bullshit; bullshit detection; complementary\nand alternative; conspiratorial ideation; dual; process theories;\nreligiosity; supernatural beliefs", "file": "All Papers/P/Pennycook et al. 2015 - On Bullshit.pdf", "year": "2015", "pages": "1--22", "number": "6", "volume": "10", "author": "Pennycook, Gordon and Allan, James and Nathaniel, Cheyne and\nDerek, Barr and Fugelsang, Koehler Jonathan A", "title": "{On Bullshit}", "ENTRYTYPE": "article", "ID": "Pennycook2015-px"}]
