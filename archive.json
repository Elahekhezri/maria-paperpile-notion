While both Firth and Harris are cited in all major\nNLP textbooks and many foundational papers, the content and\ndifferences between their theories is seldom discussed. Engaging\nin a close reading of their work, we discover two distinct and\nin many ways divergent theories of meaning.

In this work, we create an\nexperimental framework to measure the effects of different types\nof stylistic and social bias within training data for the\npurposes of literary classification, as one important subclass\nof cultural material. Because historical collections are often\nsparsely annotated, much like our knowledge of history is\nincomplete, researchers often cannot know the underlying\ndistributions of different document types and their various\nsub-classes.

One approach to detecting paraphrases is\nto use predicate argument tuples. Although this approach achieves\nhigh paraphrase recall, its accuracy is generally low. Other\napproaches focus on matching similar words, but word meaning is\noften contextual (e.g., 'get along with,' 'look forward to'). An\neffective approach to detecting plagiarism would take into\naccount the fact that plagiarists frequently cut and paste whole\nphrases and/or replace several words with similar words. This\ngenerally results in the paraphrased text containing identical\nphrases and similar words. Moreover, plagiarists usually insert\nand/or remove various minor words (prepositions, conjunctions,\netc.) to both improve the naturalness and disguise the\nparaphrasing. We have developed a similarity matching (SimMat)\nmetric for detecting paraphrases that is based on matching\nidentical phrases and similar words and quantifying the minor\nwords. The metric achieved the highest paraphrase detection\naccuracy (77.6\\%) when it was combined with eight standard\nmachine translation metrics.

The exploitation of this\nunprecedented resource under a computational frame- work can\nbring a phase transition in our understanding of human social\nbehavior and shape the future of social media systems. This\nthesis describes a computational ap- proach to an intriguing\naspect of conversational behavior, linguistic style coordination:\nconversational participants tend to immediately and unconsciously\nadapt to each other's language styles; a speaker will even adjust\nthe number of articles and other function words in their next\nutterance in response to the number in their partner's\nimmediately preceding utterance. We develop a probabilistic\nframework that can model and quantify this phenomenon and apply\nit to four different conversational settings: Twitter\nconversations, discussions betweenWikipedia editors, oral\narguments in the U.S. Supreme Court and movie script dialogs. We\nare able to examine linguistic style coordination in large scale\nsettings for the first time, and by doing so, to reveal important\nproperties that were never observed in previous studies, which\nwere conducted mainly in small and controlled environments. The\nresulting new understanding of conversational behavior bears\npractical impor- tance in the task of uncovering key properties\nof social relations. We present an analysis framework based on\nlinguistic coordination that can be used to shed light on power\nre- lationships and that works consistently across multiple types\nof power --- including a more ``static'' form of power based on\nstatus differences, and a more ``situational'' form of power in\nwhich one individual experiences a type of dependence on another.\nFinally, our computational framework can be employed to gain\ninsight into the causal mechanism behind coordination behavior.\nIt was previously hypothesized in the psycho-linguistic\nliterature that coordination has arisen as a way to achieve\nsocial goals, such as gaining approval or emphasizing difference\nin status. But has the adaptation mechanism become so deeply\nembedded in the language-generation process as to be- come a\nreflex? We argue that fictional dialogs offer a way to study this\nquestion, since authors create the conversations but don't\nreceive the social benefits (rather, the imag- ined characters\ndo). Indeed, we find significant coordination across many\nfamilies of function words in our large movie-script corpus. We\nthereby provide evidence that lan- guage coordination is so\nimplanted within our conception of conversational behavior that,\neven if such coordination is socially motivated, it is exhibited\neven when the per- son generating the language in question is not\nreceiving any of the presumed social advantages.", "keywords": "NLP \\&amp; Social Interaction"}, {"title": "Distributed Representations Of Words To Guide Bootstrapped Entity Classifiers", "authors": "Christopher D Manning", "year": "2014", "ref_id": "Manning2014-ly", "link": "", "abstract": "", "keywords": "Recognition;Word Embeddings"}, {"title": "Modelling The Combination Of Generic And Target Domain Embeddings In A Convolutional Neural Network For Sentence Classification", "authors": "Nut Limsopatham, Nigel Collier", "year": "2016", "ref_id": "Limsopatham2016-cu", "link": "https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/bitstream/handle/1810/260433/Limsopatham_et_al-2016-Proceedings_of_the_15th_Workshop_on_Biomedical_Natural_Language_Processing-AM.pdf?sequence=2&isAllowed=y", "abstract": "", "keywords": "medical;2017 Combining Embeddings;Synonym Discovery"}, {"title": "Hate Speech Detection: A Brief Literature Review Focusing On Arabic", "authors": "Anonymous Acl Submission", "year": "", "ref_id": "Submission_undated-ap", "link": "", "abstract": "", "keywords": ""}, {"title": "Linguistic Models For Analyzing And Detecting Biased Language", "authors": "Marta Recasens, Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil  Cristian And Jurafsky  Dan", "year": "2013", "ref_id": "Recasens2013-xt", "link": "https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~cristian/Biased_language_files/neutrality.pdf", "abstract": "", "keywords": "bias;Bias;2020 Book Reviews, Genre, Expertise"}, {"title": "Phrase-Based \\& Neural Unsupervised Machine Translation", "authors": "Guillaume Lample, Myle Ott, Alexis Conneau", "year": "", "ref_id": "Lample_undated-br", "link": "https://github.com/facebookresearch/", "abstract": "", "keywords": "2018 EMNLP"}, {"title": "Explaining And Generalizing Skip-Gram Through Exponential Family Principal Component Analysis", "authors": "Ryan Cotterell, Adam Poliak, Van Durme  Benjamin And Eisner  Jason", "year": "2017", "ref_id": "Cotterell2017-jo", "link": "https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~jason/papers/cotterell+al.eacl17.pdf", "abstract": "", "keywords": "Word Embeddings;Linear Algebra/Numerical Methods"}, {"title": "Grammatical Templates: Improving Text Difficulty Evaluation For Language Learners", "authors": "Shuhan Wang, Erik Andersen", "year": "", "ref_id": "Wang_undated-ol", "link": "", "abstract": "", "keywords": "nlp-seminar;NLP Seminar"}, {"title": "Unity In Diversity: Learning Distributed Heterogeneous Sentence Representation For Extractive Summarization", "authors": "Abhishek Singh, Manish Gupta, Vasudeva Varma", "year": "2018", "ref_id": "Singh2018-lq", "link": "https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/7d4c/40d382985351d1099f9da2bd61f048fe328a.pdf", "abstract": "", "keywords": "summarization;unsupervised;Summarization (Unsupervised)"}, {"title": "Learning To Classify Documents According To Formal And Informal Style", "authors": "Fa Sheikha, Diana Inkpen", "year": "2012", "ref_id": "Sheikha2012-pz", "link": "http://elanguage.net/journals/lilt/article/view/2844", "abstract": "", "keywords": "Miscellaneous"}, {"title": "Predicting Factuality Of Reporting And Bias Of News Media Sources", "authors": "Ramy Baly, Georgi Karadzhov, Alexandrov  Dimitar And Glass  James, Preslav Nakov", "year": "", "ref_id": "Baly_undated-xt", "link": "", "abstract": "", "keywords": "2018 EMNLP"}, {"title": "Hanging By A (Reddit) Thread: An Analysis Of Gamer Identity Discourse In An Online Forum", "authors": "Karina Fitzgerald", "year": "2020", "ref_id": "Fitzgerald2020-ju", "link": "http://search.proquest.com/openview/1988b80f570bd32a119c59a0a073be58/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=18750&diss=y", "abstract": "\u2026 2018).

Genre fiction or\n``genred'' fiction carries with it a mark of marginality. A\ntypical remark from a New York Times Book Reviewdemonstrates this\npattern: ``science fiction will never be Literature with a\ncapital `'L,'' and this is because it inevitably proceeds from\npremise rather than character'' (Birkerts). Similarly, fiction\ntitles of specific genres such as Western and Science Fiction\nbear conspicuous labels that distinguish works like Dunefrom the\nunmarked, real fiction, saying in effect, ``Warning---this is not\nreally Literature.''

It is my goal to reach an understanding of the\nconflicting generic sensibilities established by video game\njournalism on the one hand and game studies scholarship on the\nother. A common rhetorical phenomenon in writing about video\ngames is to begin with a broad statement invoking the volume of\ngames produced or the surpassing quality of the most recent\ngeneration of games to ``wow'' skeptics into considering the\npossibility that games mean something more than play. As this\nessay has a more meta-critical approach, it seems appropriate\ninstead to pay appropriate respect to the growing amount of\ncritical literature on gaming and avoid the apologetics that many\nearlier scholars have felt obligated to undergo. Games have\nindeed come a long way, and so has game scholarship. The recent\npublication of The Video Game Theory Reader (edited by Mark J.P.\nWolf and Bernard Perron) indicates both that reading is an\nappropriate task for learning about games and that a critical\nmass of viewpoints exists to justify an anthology of wildly\ndifferent and, sometimes, antithetical scholarship on video games", "keywords": "gaming;game-genres;2020 MSR"}, {"title": "CoSimRank : A Flexible \\& Efficient Graph-Theoretic Similarity Measure", "authors": "Sascha Rothe, Language Processing", "year": "2014", "ref_id": "Rothe2014-pe", "link": "", "abstract": "", "keywords": "Master's Thesis"}, {"title": "Psychological Writing And Letters", "authors": "Sigmund Freud", "year": "", "ref_id": "Freud_undated-cv", "link": "", "abstract": "", "keywords": "Space of Literature"}, {"title": "A Spatial Model For Extracting And Visualizing Latent Discourse Structure In Text", "authors": "Shashank Srivastava, Nebojsa Jojic", "year": "2018", "ref_id": "Srivastava2018-xf", "link": "http://aclweb.org/anthology/P18-1211", "abstract": "", "keywords": "narrative;Narrative"}, {"title": "Graph Based Similarity Measures For Synonym Extraction From Parsed Text", "authors": "Einat Minkov, William W Cohen", "year": "2012", "ref_id": "Minkov2012-cj", "link": "", "abstract": "", "keywords": "Master's Thesis"}, {"title": "Deeper Into Bullshit", "authors": "G A Cohen", "year": "2002", "ref_id": "Cohen2002-qs", "link": "", "abstract": "(from the introduction) Addresses H.

To this end, we gather and analyze ex- tensive content\ntraces from Whisper (anonymous) and Twitter (non-anonymous)\nsocial media sites. We introduce the notion of anonymity\nsensitivity of a social media post, which captures the extent to\nwhich users think the post should be anonymous. We also propose\na human annotator based methodology to measure the same for\nWhisper and Twitter posts. Our analysis reveals that anonymity\nsensitivity of most whispers (unlike tweets) is not binary.\nInstead, most whispers exhibit many shades or different levels\nof anonymity. We also find that the linguistic differences\nbetween whispers and tweets are so significant that we could\ntrain automated classifiers to distinguish between them with\nreasonable accuracy.

Humans develop the ability to communicate\nwith a large community by coordinating with different\ninterlocutors within short conversations. This ability is\nlargely understudied by the research on building neural language\ncommunicative agents. We study the task of few-shot language\ncoordination: agents quickly adapting to their conversational\npartners' language abilities. Different from current\ncommunicative agents trained with self-play, we in- investigate\nthis more general paradigm by requiring the lead agent to\ncoordinate with a population of agents each of whom has\ndifferent linguistic abilities. This leads to a general agent\nable to quickly adapt to communicating with unseen agents in the\npopulation. Unlike prior work, success here requires the ability\nto model the partner's beliefs, a vital component of human\ncommunication. Drawing inspiration from the study of\ntheory-of-mind (ToM; Premack \\& Woodruff (1978)), we study the\neffect of the speaker explicitly modeling the listener's mental\nstate. Learning by communicating with a population, the\nspeakers, as shown in our experiments, acquire the ability to\nlearn to predict the reactions of their partner upon various\nmessages on-the-fly. The speaker's predictions for the future\nactions help it generate the best instructions in order to\nmaximize communicative goal with message costs. To examine our\nhypothesis that the instructions generated with ToM modeling\nyield better communication per- performance, we employ our\nagents in both a referential game and a language navigation\ntask. Positive results from our experiments also hint at the\nimportance of explicitly modeling language acquisition as a\nsocio-pragmatic progress.", "keywords": "NLP Seminar"}, {"title": "How Naked Is The Naked Truth?

Narrative structure is an anvil for forging new\nartificial intelligence and machine learning techniques, and is\na window into abstraction and conceptual learning as well as\ninto culture and its in influence on cognition. I advance our\nunderstanding of narrative structure by describing Analogical\nStory Merging (ASM), a new machine learning algorithm that can\nextract culturally-relevant plot patterns from sets of\nfolktales. I demonstrate that ASM can learn a substantive\nportion of Vladimir Propp's in influential theory of the\nstructure of folktale plots. The challenge was to take\ndescriptions at one semantic level, namely, an event timeline as\ndescribed in folktales, and abstract to the next higher level:\nstructures such as Villainy, Stuggle- Victory, and Reward. ASM\nis based on Bayesian Model Merging, a technique for learning\nregular grammars. I demonstrate that, despite ASM's large search\nspace, a carefully-tuned prior allows the algorithm to converge,\nand furthermore it reproduces Propp's categories with a\nchance-adjusted Rand index of 0.511 to 0.714. Three important\ncategories are identied with F-measures above 0.8. The data are\n15 Russian folktales, comprising 18,862 words, a subset of\nPropp's original tales. This subset was annotated for 18 aspects\nof meaning by 12 annotators using the Story Workbench, a general\ntext-annotation tool I developed for this work. Each aspect was\ndoubly-annotated and adjudicated at inter-annotator F-measures\nthat cluster around 0.7 to 0.8. It is the largest, most\ndeeply-annotated narrative corpus assembled to date. The work\nhas significance far beyond folktales. First, it points the way\ntoward important applications in many domains, including\ninformation retrieval, persuasion and negotiation, natural\nlanguage understanding and generation, and computational\ncreativity. Second, abstraction from natural language semantics\nis a skill that underlies many cognitive tasks, and so this work\nprovides insight into those processes.

Usages of\nthese expressions can be ambiguous between an idiomatic usage and\na literal combination. In this paper we propose supervised and\nunsupervised approaches, based on word embeddings, to identifying\ntoken instances of VNICs. Our proposed supervised and\nunsupervised approaches perform better than the supervised and\nunsupervised approaches of Fazly et al. (2009), respectively. 1\nVerb--noun Idiomatic Combinations Much research on multiword\nexpressions (MWEs) in natural language processing (NLP) has\nfocused on various type-level prediction tasks, e.g., MWE\nextraction (e.g., Church and Hanks, 1990; Smadja, 1993; Lin,\n1999) --- i.e., determining which MWE types are present in a\ngiven corpus (Baldwin and Kim, 2010) --- and compositionality\nprediction (e.g., McCarthy et al., 2003; Reddy et al., 2011;\nSalehi et al., 2014). However, word combinations can be ambiguous\nbetween literal combinations and MWEs. For example, consider the\nfollowing two usages of the expression hit the roof : 1. I think\nPaula might hit the roof if you start ironing. 2. When the blood\nhit the roof of the car I realised it was serious. The first\nexample of hit the roof is an idiomatic usage, while the second\nis a literal combination.1 MWE identification is the task of\ndetermining These examples, and idiomaticity judgements, are\ntaken from Cook et al. (2008). which token instances in running\ntext are MWEs (Baldwin and Kim, 2010). Although there has been\nrelatively less work on MWE identification than other type-level\nMWE prediction tasks, it is nevertheless important for NLP\napplications such as machine translation that must be able to\ndistinguish MWEs from literal combinations in context. Some\nrecent work has focused on token-level identification of a wide\nrange of types of MWEs and other multiword units (e.g., Newman et\nal., 2012; Schneider et al., 2014; Brooke et al., 2014). Many\nstudies, however, have taken a word sense\ndisambiguation--inspired approach to MWE identification (e.g.,\nBirke and Sarkar, 2006; Katz and Giesbrecht, 2006; Li et al.,\n2010), treating literal combinations and MWEs as different word\nsenses, and have exploited linguistic knowledge of MWEs (e.g.,\nPatrick and Fletcher, 2005; Uchiyama et al., 2005; Hashimoto and\nKawahara, 2008; Fazly et al., 2009; Fothergill and Baldwin,\n2012). In this study we focus on English verb--noun idiomatic\ncombinations (VNICs). VNICs are formed from a verb with a noun in\nits direct object position. They are a common and productive type\nof English idiom, and occur cross-lingually (Fazly et al., 2009).\nVNICs tend to be relatively lexico-syntactically fixed, e.g.,\nwhereas hit the roof is ambiguous between literal and idiomatic\nmeanings, hit the roofs and a roof was hit are most likely to be\nliteral usages. Fazly et al. (2009) exploit this property in\ntheir unsupervised approach, referred to as CFORM. They define\nlexico-syntactic patterns for VNIC token instances based on the\nnoun's determiner (e.g., a, the, or possibly no determiner), the\nnumber of the noun (singular or plural), and the verb's voice\n(active or passive). They propose a statistical method for\nautomatically determining a given VNIC type's canonical idiomatic\nform, based on the frequency of its usage in these", "keywords": "compositionality;2016 Uncanny / Anomaly"}, {"title": "Non-distributional Word Vector Representations", "authors": "Manaal Faruqui, Chris Dyer", "year": "", "ref_id": "Faruqui_undated-eh", "link": "", "abstract": "", "keywords": "Word Embeddings"}, {"title": "Effective Measures Of Domain Similarity For Parsing", "authors": "Barbara Plank, Gertjan Van Noord", "year": "2011", "ref_id": "Plank2011-lv", "link": "https://aclanthology.org/P11-1157", "abstract": "", "keywords": "domain-adaptation"}, {"title": "Contextualized Sarcasm Detection On Twitter", "authors": "David Bamman, Noah A Smith", "year": "2011", "ref_id": "Bamman2011-jk", "link": "", "abstract": "", "keywords": "Inspiration"}, {"title": "Entity Linking For Biomedical Literature", "authors": "Jin Guang Zheng, Daniel Howsmon, Boliang Zhang, Juergen Hahn, N Y United States", "year": "", "ref_id": "Zheng_undated-nr", "link": "", "abstract": "", "keywords": "biomedical lit-; bological ontologies; entity linking; semantic\nweb; signal; text mining; transduction; wikification;Linking"}, {"title": "Proceedings Of The International Joint Workshop On Computational Creativity 2008", "authors": "Pablo Gerv, Rafael P", "year": "2008", "ref_id": "Gerv2008-qf", "link": "", "abstract": "We describe the integration of MEXICA, a well-developed story\ngeneration system which produces high-level plots, with the nn\nNarrator, an existing system for automatically narrating based on\na simulated world and a plan with narrative specifications.

NERL is tuned to the\nneeds of NER tasks and simplifies the process of building,\nunderstanding, and customizing complex rule-based named-entity\nannotators. We show that these customized annotators match or\noutperform the best published results achieved with machine\nlearning techniques. These results confirm that we can reap the\nbenefits of rule-based extractors' explainability without\nsacrificing accuracy. We conclude by discussing lessons learned\nwhile building and customizing complex rule-based annotators and\noutlining several research directions towards facilitating rule\ndevelopment.", "keywords": "Recognition;Domain Adaptation"}, {"title": "Text Processing For The Effective Application Of Latent Dirichlet Allocation", "authors": "Alexandra Schofield", "year": "", "ref_id": "Schofield_undated-ez", "link": "https://ecommons.cornell.edu/bitstream/handle/1813/67305/SCHOFIELD_cornellgrad_0058F_11395.pdf?sequence=1", "abstract": "", "keywords": ""}, {"title": "Experimental Evidence On The Productivity Effects Of Generative Artificial Intelligence", "authors": "Shakked Noy, Mit Whitney, Zhang Mit, Daron Acemoglu, Nikhil Agarwal, David Autor, Barros  Lucas And Benheim  Talia, Amy Finkelstein, Horton  John And J\u00e4ger  Simon, Ailidh Leslie, Mejia  Jackson And Noy  Ilan, Liora Noy, Emily Partridge, Charlie Rafkin, Aakaash Rao, Nina Roussille, Roth  Chris And Schilbach  Frank, Benjamin Schoefer, Lexi Schubert, Advik Shreekumar", "year": "", "ref_id": "Noy_undated-ao", "link": "https://economics.mit.edu/sites/default/files/inline-files/Noy_Zhang_1.pdf", "abstract": "", "keywords": ""}, {"title": "Model Criticism For Long-Form Text Generation", "authors": "Yuntian Deng, Volodymyr Kuleshov, Alexander M Rush", "year": "", "ref_id": "Deng_undated-ag", "link": "https://github.com/da03", "abstract": "da03 has 66 repositories available.

We\nillustrate how this model can be used for information retrieval\nby matching documents both at a general topic level and at a\nspecific word level, providing an advantage over techniques that\nonly match documents at a general level (such as topic models or\nlatent-sematic indexing) or that only match documents at the\nspecific word level (such as TF-IDF).", "keywords": "Week 4"}, {"title": "Optimizing Semantic Coherence In Topic Models", "authors": "David Mimno, Hanna Wallach, Edmund Talley, Miriam Leenders, Andrew McCallum", "year": "2011", "ref_id": "Mimno2011-xv", "link": "https://aclanthology.org/D11-1024", "abstract": "", "keywords": "topic-modeling"}, {"title": "Predicting The Rise And Fall Of Scientific Topics From Trends In Their Rhetorical Framing", "authors": "Vinodkumar Prabhakaran, William L Hamilton, Dan McFarland, Dan Jurafsky", "year": "2016", "ref_id": "Prabhakaran2016-sf", "link": "https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/f6aa/542808427698c8fffdba8c7b7b70c98c3754.pdf", "abstract": "", "keywords": "framing-and-agenda-setting;topic-modeling;favorites \ud83d\udc95;2020 Book\nReviews, Genre, Expertise"}, {"title": "Political Ideology Detection Using Recursive Neural Networks", "authors": "Mohit Iyyer, Peter Enns, Jordan Boyd-Graber, Philip Resnik", "year": "2014", "ref_id": "Iyyer2014-vi", "link": "", "abstract": "", "keywords": "bias;Deep Learning"}, {"title": "The Geometry Of Culture: Analyzing Meaning Through Word Embeddings", "authors": "Austin C.

In\nthis paper, we consider the case where there is a confounding\nvariable Z that influences both the text features X and the class\nvariable Y . For example, a classifier trained to predict the\nhealth status of a user based on their online communications may\nbe confounded by socioeconomic variables. When the influence of Z\nchanges from training to testing data, we find that classifier\naccuracy can degrade rapidly. Our approach, based on Pearl's\nback-door adjustment, estimates the underlying effect of a text\nvariable on the class variable while controlling for the\nconfounding variable. Although our goal is prediction, not causal\ninference, we find that such adjustments are essential to\nbuilding text classifiers that are robust to confounding\nvariables.

Some concerns regarding their use include cost\nof placement, side effects, and perception of frequent early\nremoval. This study evaluated satisfaction with LARC,\nfrequency, and reasons behind early removal in a family\nmedicine setting. METHODS: Women > 18 years seen for placement\nof removal of an IUD or SDI were identified from billing data\nand surveyed via telephone to determine satisfaction and side\neffects with LARC. Additional demographic information was\nextracted from the electronic health record. RESULTS: Of the\n132 respondents (response rate 61.4\\%), 58.3\\% had IUDs and\n41.7\\% had SDIs placed. Early removal occurred in 24.2\\% of\nwomen, and 72.7\\% were satisfied with their contraceptive\nchoice. Younger and nulliparous women were more likely to have\nan SDI placed, whereas older and multiparous women chose the\nIUD. Younger nulliparous women were less likely to have LARC\nremoved early. Pain (more commonly reported with the IUD) and\nincreased frequency in bleeding (more commonly reported with\nthe SDI) were associated with early removal rates.\nCONCLUSIONS: Most women who received LARC were satisfied with\ntheir contraceptive choice, and only one in four had the LARC\nremoved early. This is significantly better than continuation\nrates with other contraceptive methods. Younger, nulliparous\nwomen were good candidates for LARC, continuing their use more\nthan older, multiparous women. Improved counseling regarding\npain and changes in menstrual bleeding patterns may impact\nearly removal of IUDs and SDIs, respectively.", "keywords": "birth-control;reproductive-healthcare"}, {"title": "SemEval-2015 Task 1 : Paraphrase And Semantic Similarity In Twitter ( PIT )", "authors": "Wei Xu, Chris Callison-burch, William B Dolan", "year": "2015", "ref_id": "Xu2015-fg", "link": "http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~ccb/publications/paraphrase-and-semantic-similarity-in-twitter.pdf", "abstract": "In this shared task, we present evaluations on two related tasks\nParaphrase Identification (PI) and Semantic Textual Similarity\n(SS) sys- tems for the Twitter data.

Yet it has been difficult to understand the\ncomprehensiveness of news media coverage on an event and how the\nreactions that the coverage evokes may diverge, because this\nrequires identifying the origin of an event and tracing the\ninformation all the way to individuals who consume the news. In\nthis work, we pinpoint the information source of an event in the\nform of a press release and investigate how its news cycle\nunfolds. We follow the news through three layers of propagation:\nthe news articles covering the press release, shares of those\narticles in social media, and comments on the shares. We find\nthat a news cycle typically lasts two days. Although news media\nin aggregate cover the information contained in the source, a\nsingle news article will typically only provide partial coverage.\nSentiment, while dampened in news coverage relative to the\nsource, again rises in social media shares and comments. As the\ninformation propagates through the layers, it tends to diverge\nfrom the source: while some ideas emphasized in the source fade,\nothers emerge or gain in importance.

With the availability of inexpensive and ubiquitous\nmass communication tools like social media, creating narratives,\nfalse information and propaganda is both convenient and\neffective. Social media users leverage this platform to further\ntheir views by framing narratives and participating in online\ndiscourse. Almost all events, issues, crises are discussed on\nsocial media. Blogs, unlike other social media platforms, are\nnot regulated by any authority and have no restriction on\ncharacter limit, providing bloggers with not only space for\nricher content but also serve as a platform for agenda-setting\nand content framing abetting development of narratives. This\ninnate feature of blogs makes them a valuable platform for\nsociologists/political scientists to gain situational awareness\nby tracking different opinions, political views, and narratives\nas they are shaped. However, the deluge of posts in blogosphere\nmakes it impractical to manually identify narratives. In this\npaper, we propose a novel framework to computationally identify\nnarratives by extracting actors/actions using NLP techniques\nincluding POS tagging, chunking, and grammar rules to identify\nnarratives. We also employ a scoring mechanism to rank them in\nthe order of their dominance. Later, we evaluate the efficacy of\nthe proposed model by validating against human annotated\nnarratives.

Design:\nQuantitative direct observational time and motion study\n(during office hours) and self-reported diary (after hours).\nSetting: U.S. ambulatory care in 4 specialties in 4 states\n(Illinois, New Hampshire, Virginia, and Washington).\nParticipants: 57 U.S. physicians in family medicine, internal\nmedicine, cardiology, and orthopedics who were observed for\n430 hours, 21 of whom also completed after-hours diaries.\nMeasurements: Proportions of time spent on 4 activities\n(direct clinical face time, electronic health record [EHR] and\ndesk work, administrative tasks, and other tasks) and\nself-reported after-hours work. Results: During the office\nday, physicians spent 27.0\\% of their total time on direct\nclinical face time with patients and 49.2\\% of their time on\nEHR and desk work.

In Morphology of the\nFolktale, Vladimir Propp argues against the separation of ``who\nacts'' from ``the question of the actions themselves,'' instead\nadvocating an approach that studies characters according to their\nfunctions.1 Similarly, the notion of the literary archetype, as\ninfluenced by both Joseph Campbell and Carl Jung, highlights the\nway in which what characters do influences the way we perceive\nwho characters are.2 The notion of literary stereotypes is also\ntied to this discussion. As Bamman, O'Connor, and Smith observe\nin their study of personas in film, stereotypical characters are\n``defined by a fixed set of actions widely known to be\nrepresentative of a class.''3 While actions are only one part of\na complex network of descriptive tools that authors may use to\ncreate characters, 4 they may offer us a useful insight into the\nway that certain behaviors can align with various character\nidentity traits in literature. A study of character action may\nserve as a proxy to not only demarcate character types, but also\nto investigate what behaviors, and types of behaviors, were\nconventionally aligned with different groups of characters.\nBamman, Underwood, and Smith (2014) attempt something similar in\n``A Bayesian Mixed Effects Model of Literary Character.'' In that\nwork, the authors focus on modeling specific character\n``personas'' by studying semantically related words that occur in\nproximity to character mentions. The authors note that\n``articulating what a true 'persona' might be for characters is\ninherently problematic'' and they acknowledge that the ``personas\nlearned so far [by their model] do not align neatly with\ncharacter types known to literary historians.''5 Nevertheless,\ntheir study revealed compelling associations between certain\npersonas and certain genres and, more importantly for our current\nresearch, that certain personas were ``clearly gendered.'' 6 In\nnoting the later, the authors write that ``analysis of latent\ncharacter types might cast new light on the history of gender in\nfiction.''7 Our work attempts a more direct and specific study of\ncharacter agency in the context of character gender.

Numerous studies have shown the importance of websites\nwith user forums for people seeking information related to\nhealth. Parents turn to some of these sites, colloquially\nreferred to as ``mommy blogs,'' to share concerns about\nchildren's health care, including vaccination. Although\nsubstantial work has considered the role of social media,\nparticularly Twitter, in discussions of vaccination and other\nhealth care-related issues, there has been little work on\ndescribing the underlying structure of these discussions and\nthe role of persuasive storytelling, particularly on sites\nwith no limits on post length. Understanding the role of\npersuasive storytelling at Internet scale provides useful\ninsight into how people discuss vaccinations, including\nexemption-seeking behavior, which has been tied to a recent\ndiminution of herd immunity in some communities. OBJECTIVE: To\ndevelop an automated and scalable machine-learning method for\nstory aggregation on social media sites dedicated to\ndiscussions of parenting. We wanted to discover the aggregate\nnarrative frameworks to which individuals, through their\nexchange of experiences and commentary, contribute over time\nin a particular topic domain. We also wanted to characterize\ntemporal trends in these narrative frameworks on the sites\nover the study period. METHODS: To ensure that our data\ncapture long-term discussions and not short-term reactions to\nrecent events, we developed a dataset of 1.99 million posts\ncontributed by 40,056 users and viewed 20.12 million times\nindexed from 2 parenting sites over a period of 105 months.\nUsing probabilistic methods, we determined the topics of\ndiscussion on these parenting sites. We developed a generative\nstatistical-mechanical narrative model to automatically\nextract the underlying stories and story fragments from\nmillions of posts. We aggregated the stories into an\noverarching narrative framework graph. In our model, stories\nwere represented as network graphs with actants as nodes and\ntheir various relationships as edges. We estimated the latent\nstories circulating on these sites by modeling the posts as a\nsampling of the hidden narrative framework graph. Temporal\ntrends were examined based on monthly user-poststatistics.\nRESULTS: We discovered that discussions of exemption from\nvaccination requirements are highly represented. We found a\nstrong narrative framework related to exemption seeking and a\nculture of distrust of government and medical institutions.\nVarious posts reinforced part of the narrative framework graph\nin which parents, medical professionals, and religious\ninstitutions emerged as key nodes, and exemption seeking\nemerged as an important edge. In the aggregate story, parents\nused religion or belief to acquire exemptions to protect their\nchildren from vaccines that are required by schools or\ngovernment institutions, but (allegedly) cause adverse\nreactions such as autism, pain, compromised immunity, and even\ndeath. Although parents joined and left the discussion forums\nover time, discussions and stories about exemptions were\npersistent and robust to these membership changes.\nCONCLUSIONS: Analyzing parent forums about health care using\nan automated analytic approach, such as the one presented\nhere, allows the detection of widespread narrative frameworks\nthat structure and inform discussions. In most vaccination\nstories from the sites we analyzed, it is taken for granted\nthat vaccines and not vaccine preventable diseases (VPDs) pose\na threat to children. Because vaccines are seen as a threat,\nparents focus on sharing successful strategies for avoiding\nthem, with exemption being the foremost among these\nstrategies. When new parents join such sites, they may be\nexposed to this endemic narrative framework in the threads\nthey read and to which they contribute, which may influence\ntheir health care decision making.", "keywords": "Internet; attitudes; health knowledge; machine learning;\npersonal narratives; practice; social media;\nvaccination;favorites \ud83d\udc95;narrative"}, {"title": "Content-Sensitive Characterization Of Peer Interactions Of Highly Engaged Users In An Online Community For Smoking Cessation: Mixed-Methods Approach For Modeling User Engagement In Health Promotion Interventions", "authors": "Sahiti Myneni, Vishnupriya Sridharan, Cobb  Nathan And Cohen  Trevor", "year": "2018", "ref_id": "Myneni2018-of", "link": "http://jopm.jmir.org/2018/3/e9/", "abstract": "Background: Online communities provide affordable venues for\nbehavior change.

METHODS: We conducted a longitudinal network analysis of\nanonymized data from 2 patients' online communities from the\nUnited Kingdom: the Asthma UK and the British Lung Foundation\n(BLF) communities in 2006-2016 and 2012-2016, respectively.\nRESULTS: The number of users and activity grew steadily over\ntime, reaching 3345 users and 32,780 posts in the Asthma UK\ncommunity, and 19,837 users and 875,151 posts in the BLF\ncommunity. People who wrote posts in the Asthma UK forum\ntended to write at an interval of 1-20 days and six months,\nwhile those in the BLF community wrote at an interval of two\ndays. In both communities, most pairs of users could reach one\nanother either directly or indirectly through other users.\nThose who wrote a disproportionally large number of posts (the\nsuperusers) represented 1\\% of the overall population of both\nAsthma UK and BLF communities and accounted for 32\\% and 49\\%\nof the posts, respectively. Sensitivity analysis showed that\nthe removal of superusers would cause the communities to\ncollapse. Thus, interactions were held together by very few\nsuperusers, who posted frequently and regularly, 65\\% of them\nat least every 1.7 days in the BLF community and 70\\% every\n3.1 days in the Asthma UK community. Their posting activity\nindirectly facilitated tie formation between other users.\nSuperusers were a constantly available resource, with a mean\nof 80 and 20 superusers active at any one time in the BLF and\nAsthma UK communities, respectively. Over time, the more\nactive users became, the more likely they were to reply to\nother users' posts rather than to write new ones, shifting\nfrom a help-seeking to a help-giving role.

In an ethnographic study, Gabbay and Le May showed\nthat clinicians in everyday practice situations do not\nexplicitly or consciously use guidelines. Instead, they use\nmindlines: collectively shared, mostly tacit knowledge that is\nshaped by many sources, including accumulated personal\nexperiences, education (formal and informal), guidance, and\nthe narratives about patients that are shared among\ncolleagues. In this study on informal knowledge, we consider\nvirtual networks of clinicians as representative of the\nmindlines in the wider medical community, as holders of\nknowledge, as well as catalysts of knowing.

The second was to\ndemonstrate the value of computer coding of conversational\ndata using machine learning techniques (1) by replicating\nresults derived from human-coded data about how people elicit\nsupport and (2) by answering questions that are intractable\nwith small samples of human-coded data, namely how exposure to\ndifferent types of social support predicts continued\nparticipation in online support communities. The third was to\nprovide a detailed description of these machine learning\ntechniques to enable other researchers to perform large-scale\ndata analysis in these communities. METHODS: Communication\namong approximately 90,000 registered users of an online\ncancer support community was analyzed. The corpus comprised\n1,562,459 messages organized into 68,158 discussion threads.\nAmazon Mechanical Turk workers coded (1) 1000 thread-starting\nmessages on 5 attributes (positive and negative emotional\nself-disclosure, positive and negative informational\nself-disclosure, questions) and (2) 1000 replies on emotional\nand informational support. Their judgments were used to train\nmachine learning models that automatically estimated the\namount of these 7 attributes in the messages. Across\nattributes, the average Pearson correlation between\nhuman-based judgments and computer-based judgments was .65.\nRESULTS: Part 1 used human-coded data to investigate\nrelationships between (1) 4 kinds of self-disclosure and\nquestion asking in thread-starting posts and (2) the amount of\nemotional and informational support in the first reply.\nSelf-disclosure about negative emotions (beta=.24, P<.001),\nnegative events (beta=.25, P<.001), and positive events\n(beta=.10, P=.02) increased emotional support. However, asking\nquestions depressed emotional support (beta=-.21, P<.001). In\ncontrast, asking questions increased informational support\n(beta=.38, P<.001), whereas positive informational\nself-disclosure depressed it (beta=-.09, P=.003).\nSelf-disclosure led to the perception of emotional needs,\nwhich elicited emotional support, whereas asking questions led\nto the perception of informational needs, which elicited\ninformational support. Part 2 used machine-coded data to\nreplicate these results. Part 3 analyzed the machine-coded\ndata and showed that exposure to more emotional support\npredicted staying in the group longer 33\\% (hazard ratio=0.67,\nP<.001), whereas exposure to more informational support\npredicted leaving the group sooner (hazard ratio=1.05,\nP<.001). CONCLUSIONS: Self-disclosure is effective in\neliciting emotional support, whereas question asking is\neffective in eliciting informational support.

Little is known about how\npregnant women engage with technologies and the interface between\nthese tools and medical care, especially for women of lower\nsocioeconomic status. Objective: We sought to understand how\nwomen use technology during pregnancy through a qualitative study\nwith women enrolled in the Women, Infants, and Children (WIC)\nprogram. Methods: We recruited pregnant women ages 18 and older\nwho owned a smartphone, at a WIC clinic in central Pennsylvania.\nThe focus group guide included questions about women's current\npregnancy, their sources of information, and whether they used\ntechnology for pregnancy-related information. Sessions were\naudiotaped and transcribed. Three members of the research team\nindependently analyzed each transcript, using a thematic analysis\napproach. Themes related to the topics discussed were identified,\nfor which there was full agreement. Results: Four focus groups\nwere conducted with a total of 17 women. Three major themes\nemerged as follows. First, the prenatal visit structure is not\npatient-centered, with the first visit perceived as occurring too\nlate and with too few visits early in pregnancy when women have\nthe most questions for their prenatal care providers.\nUnfortunately, the educational materials women received during\nprenatal care were viewed as unhelpful. Second, women turn to\ntechnology (eg, Google, smartphone applications) to fill their\nknowledge gaps. Turning to technology was viewed to be a\ngenerational approach. Finally, women reported that technology,\nalthough frequently used, has limitations. Conclusions: The\nresults of this qualitative research suggest that the current\nprenatal care visit structure is not patient-centered in that it\ndoes not allow women to seek advice when they want it most. A\ngenerational shift seems to have occurred, resulting in pregnant\nwomen in our study turning to the Internet and smartphones to\nfill this gap, which requires significant skills to navigate for\nuseful information. Future steps may include developing\ninterventions to help health care providers assist patients early\nin pregnancy to seek the information they want and to become\nbetter consumers of Internet-based pregnancy resources.", "keywords": "Consumer health informatics; Internet; Mhealth; Mobile phones;\nPatient education; Pregnancy resources; Prenatal care;\nQualitative research; Smartphones; Women infants and children\nProgram;2019 Birth Stories"}, {"title": "Protected Health Information On Social Networking Sites: Ethical And Legal Considerations", "authors": "Lindsay A Thompson, Erik Black, Duff  W Patrick And Paradise Black  Nicole, Heidi Saliba, Kara Dawson", "year": "2011", "ref_id": "Thompson2011-zm", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.2196/jmir.1590", "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Social networking site use is increasingly common\namong emerging medical professionals, with medical schools\neven reporting disciplinary student expulsion. Medical\nprofessionals who use social networking sites have unique\nresponsibilities since their postings could violate patient\nprivacy. However, it is unknown whether students and residents\nportray protected health information and under what\ncircumstances or contexts. OBJECTIVE: The objective of our\nstudy was to document and describe online portrayals of\npotential patient privacy violations in the Facebook profiles\nof medical students and residents. METHODS: A\nmultidisciplinary team performed two cross-sectional analyses\nat the University of Florida in 2007 and 2009 of all medical\nstudents and residents to see who had Facebook profiles. For\neach identified profile, we manually scanned the entire\nprofile for any textual or photographic representations of\nprotected health information, such as portrayals of people,\nnames, dates, or descriptions of procedures. RESULTS: Almost\nhalf of all eligible students and residents had Facebook\nprofiles (49.8\\%, or n=1023 out of 2053). There were 12\ninstances of potential patient violations, in which students\nand residents posted photographs of care they provided to\nindividuals. No resident or student posted any identifiable\npatient information or likeness in text form. Each instance\noccurred in developing countries on apparent medical mission\ntrips. These portrayals increased over time (1 in the 2007\ncohort; 11 in 2009; P = .03). Medical students were more\nlikely to have these potential violations on their profiles\nthan residents (11 vs 1, P = .04), and there was no difference\nby gender. Photographs included trainees interacting with\nidentifiable patients, all children, or performing medical\nexaminations or procedures such as vaccinations of children.\nCONCLUSIONS: While students and residents in this study are\nposting photographs that are potentially violations of patient\nprivacy, they only seem to make this lapse in the setting of\nmedical mission trips. Trainees need to learn to equate\nstandards of patient privacy in all medical contexts using\nboth legal and ethical arguments to maintain the highest\nprofessional principles. We propose three practical\nguidelines. First, there should be a legal resource for\nphysicians traveling on medical mission trips such as an\nonline list of local laws, or a telephone legal contact.\nSecond, institutions that organize medical mission trips\nshould plan an ethics seminar prior the departure on any trip\nsince the legal and ethical implications may not be intuitive.\nFinally, at minimum, traveling physicians should apply the\nstrictest legal precedent to any situation.", "keywords": "medical;ethics;data-ethics;2019 Birth Stories"}, {"title": "Public Attitudes To Digital Health Research Repositories: Cross-sectional International Survey", "authors": "Giovanna Nunes Vilaza, David Coyle, Jakob Eyvind Bardram", "year": "2021", "ref_id": "Nunes_Vilaza2021-dh", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.2196/31294", "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Digital health research repositories propose\nsharing longitudinal streams of health records and personal\nsensing data between multiple projects and researchers.\nMotivated by the prospect of personalizing patient care\n(precision medicine), these initiatives demand broad public\nacceptance and large numbers of data contributors, both of\nwhich are challenging. OBJECTIVE: This study investigates\npublic attitudes toward possibly contributing to digital\nhealth research repositories to identify factors for their\nacceptance and to inform future developments. METHODS: A\ncross-sectional online survey was conducted from March 2020 to\nDecember 2020. Because of the funded project scope and a\nmulticenter collaboration, study recruitment targeted young\nadults in Denmark and Brazil, allowing an analysis of the\ndifferences between 2 very contrasting national contexts.\nThrough closed-ended questions, the survey examined\nparticipants' willingness to share different data types, data\naccess preferences, reasons for concern, and motivations to\ncontribute. The survey also collected information about\nparticipants' demographics, level of interest in health\ntopics, previous participation in health research, awareness\nof examples of existing research data repositories, and\ncurrent attitudes about digital health research repositories.\nData analysis consisted of descriptive frequency measures and\nstatistical inferences (bivariate associations and logistic\nregressions). RESULTS: The sample comprises 1017 respondents\nliving in Brazil (1017/1600, 63.56\\%) and 583 in Denmark\n(583/1600, 36.44\\%).

Patients seek information about\nhealth conditions, guidance in treatment, and support from\npeers online, complementary to traditional health care\ntrajectories. Online communities have the potential to\ncontribute to the quality of care by increasing patient\nempowerment; however, there is a gap in research regarding in\nwhat way online communities contribute to patient empowerment.\nOBJECTIVE: We synthesized research regarding how online\ncommunities contribute to patient empowerment to address the\nresearch question ``In what ways can participation in online\ncommunities support patient empowerment?'' by studying how\npatient empowerment is operationalized in different studies.\nThe definition of patient empowerment used in this paper is\nenablement for people to develop mastery over actions and\ncontrol over decisions that influence their lives. The mastery\nis both through processes and outcomes of the development.\nMETHODS: A systematic review was conducted by searching in the\nfollowing databases: Scopus, ACM Digital Library, EBSCO\n(CINAHL and MEDLINE), PubMed, and Web of Science. In total,\nthere were 1187 papers after excluding duplicates, and through\nselection processes using an analytical framework with\ndefinitions of patient empowerment and related concepts, 33\npeer-reviewed papers were included. RESULTS: Findings\nindicated that online communities support patient empowerment\nboth as a process and as outcomes of these processes.\nAdditionally, it was seen as a complement to traditional\nhealth care and encouragement for health care professionals to\nhave a more positive attitude toward patients' usage. There\nwas a mix between deductive (19/33, 58\\%), inductive (11/33,\n33\\%), and a mixed approach (3/33, 9\\%) of studying patient\nempowerment in various forms. The online communities in most\npapers (21/33, 64\\%) were well-established and represented\npatients' initiatives. CONCLUSIONS: There is a need to include\nprofessionals' perspectives regarding how health care can\nembrace patient empowerment through online communities.

Robots\nwill not replace humans, but rather work alongside and supplement\nhuman work. Even when most of a system will be automated, the\nconcept of keeping a ``human in the loop'' assures that human\njudgment will always be able to trump automation. This rhetoric\nemphasizes fluid cooperation and shared control. In practice, the\ndynamics of shared control between human and robot are more\ncomplicated, especially with respect to issues of\naccountability.As control has become distributed across multiple\nactors, our social and legal conceptions of responsibility remain\ngenerally about an individual. If there's an accident, we\nintuitively --- and our laws, in practice --- want someone to\ntake the blame. The result of this ambiguity is that humans may\nemerge as ``moral crumple zones.'' Just as the crumple zone in a\ncar is designed to absorb the force of impact in a crash, the\nhuman in a robotic system may become simply a component ---\naccidentally or intentionally --- that is intended to bear the\nbrunt of the moral and legal penalties when the overall system\nfails.This paper employs the concept of ``moral crumple zones''\nwithin human-machine systems as a lens through which to think\nabout the limitations of current frameworks for accountability in\nhuman-machine or robot systems. The paper examines two historical\ncases of ``moral crumple zones'' in the fields of aviation and\nnuclear energy and articulates the dimensions of distributed\ncontrol at stake while also mapping the degree to which this\ncontrol of and responsibility for an action are proportionate.\nThe argument suggests that an analysis of the dimensions of\naccountability in automated and robotic systems must contend with\nhow and why accountability may be misapplied and how structural\nconditions enable this misunderstanding. How do non-human actors\nin a system effectively deflect accountability onto other human\nactors? And how might future models of robotic accountability\nrequire this deflection to be controlled? At stake is the\npotential ultimately to protect against new forms of consumer and\nworker harm.This paper presents the concept of the ``moral\ncrumple zone'' as both a challenge to and an opportunity for the\ndesign and regulation of human-robot systems. By articulating\nmismatches between control and responsibility, we argue for an\nupdated framework of accountability in human-robot systems, one\nthat can contend with the complicated dimensions of cooperation\nbetween human and robot.", "keywords": "Automation; Autonomy; Ethics; HCI; HRI; driverless cars; human\nfactors; human in the loop;Week 6"}, {"title": "Using Text Analysis To Target Government Inspections: Evidence From Restaurant Hygiene Inspections And Online Reviews", "authors": "Jun Seok Kang, Polina Kuznetsova, Yejin Choi, Michael Luca", "year": "2013", "ref_id": "Kang2013-jw", "link": "http://www.ssrn.com/abstract=2293165", "abstract": "Language Generation for Product Description Thanks to the advance\nof ML, machines now can generate readable sentences.

This may be\npartially related to the statistical significance paradigm\nused in clinical trials centered around a P value below 0.05\ncutoff. Strict use of this P value may lead to strategies of\nclinical researchers to describe their clinical results with P\nvalues approaching but not reaching the threshold to be\n``almost significant.'' The question is how phrases expressing\nnonsignificant results have been reported in RCTs over the\npast 30 years. To this end, we conducted a quantitative\nanalysis of English full texts containing 567,758 RCTs\nrecorded in PubMed between 1990 and 2020 (81.5\\% of all\npublished RCTs in PubMed). We determined the exact presence of\n505 predefined phrases denoting results that approach but do\nnot cross the line of formal statistical significance (P <\n0.05). We modeled temporal trends in phrase data with Bayesian\nlinear regression. Evidence for temporal change was obtained\nthrough Bayes factor (BF) analysis. In a randomly sampled\nsubset, the associated P values were manually extracted. We\nidentified 61,741 phrases in 49,134 RCTs indicating almost\nsignificant results (8.65\\%; 95\\% confidence interval (CI):\n8.58\\% to 8.73\\%). The overall prevalence of these phrases\nremained stable over time, with the most prevalent phrases\nbeing ``marginally significant'' (in 7,735 RCTs), ``all but\nsignificant'' (7,015), ``a nonsignificant trend'' (3,442),\n``failed to reach statistical significance'' (2,578), and ``a\nstrong trend'' (1,700). The strongest evidence for an\nincreased temporal prevalence was found for ``a numerical\ntrend,'' ``a positive trend,'' ``an increasing trend,'' and\n``nominally significant.'' In contrast, the phrases ``all but\nsignificant,'' ``approaches statistical significance,'' ``did\nnot quite reach statistical significance,'' ``difference was\napparent,'' ``failed to reach statistical significance,'' and\n``not quite significant'' decreased over time. In a random\nsampled subset of 29,000 phrases, the manually identified and\ncorresponding 11,926 P values, 68,1\\% ranged between 0.05 and\n0.15 (CI: 67. to 69.0; median 0.06). Our results show that RCT\nreports regularly contain specific phrases describing\nmarginally nonsignificant results to report P values close to\nbut above the dominant 0.05 cutoff. The fact that the\nprevalence of the phrases remained stable over time indicates\nthat this practice of broadly interpreting P values close to a\npredefined threshold remains prevalent. To enhance responsible\nand transparent interpretation of RCT results, researchers,\nclinicians, reviewers, and editors may reduce the focus on\nformal statistical significance thresholds and stimulate\nreporting of P values with corresponding effect sizes and CIs\nand focus on the clinical relevance of the statistical\ndifference found in RCTs.", "keywords": "[ Inbox ]"}, {"title": "Tethered To The EHR: Primary Care Physician Workload Assessment Using EHR Event Log Data And Time-Motion Observations", "authors": "Brian G Arndt, John W Beasley, Watkinson  Michelle D And Temte  Jonathan L, Wen-Jan Tuan, Christine A Sinsky, Valerie J Gilchrist", "year": "2017", "ref_id": "Arndt2017-lf", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1370/afm.2121", "abstract": "PURPOSE: Primary care physicians spend nearly 2 hours on\nelectronic health record (EHR) tasks per hour of direct\npatient care. Demand for non-face-to-face care, such as\ncommunication through a patient portal and administrative\ntasks, is increasing and contributing to burnout. The goal of\nthis study was to assess time allocated by primary care\nphysicians within the EHR as indicated by EHR user-event log\ndata, both during clinic hours (defined as 8:00 am to 6:00 pm\nMonday through Friday) and outside clinic hours. METHODS: We\nconducted a retrospective cohort study of 142 family medicine\nphysicians in a single system in southern Wisconsin. All Epic\n(Epic Systems Corporation) EHR interactions were captured from\n``event logging'' records over a 3-year period for both direct\npatient care and non-face-to-face activities, and were\nvalidated by direct observation. EHR events were assigned to 1\nof 15 EHR task categories and allocated to either during or\nafter clinic hours. RESULTS: Clinicians spent 355 minutes (5.9\nhours) of an 11.4-hour workday in the EHR per weekday per 1.0\nclinical full-time equivalent: 269 minutes (4.5 hours) during\nclinic hours and 86 minutes (1.4 hours) after clinic hours.\nClerical and administrative tasks including documentation,\norder entry, billing and coding, and system security accounted\nfor nearly one-half of the total EHR time (157 minutes,\n44.2\\%).

What has not\nbeen reported is the effect that birth stories may have on\nprimigravid women's understandings of birth. Findings are\npresented from a qualitative study exploring how two\ngenerations of women came to understand birth in the milieu of\nother's stories. The prior assumption was that birth stories\nmust surely have a positive or negative influence on\nlisteners, steering them towards either medical or\nmidwifery-led models of care. METHODS: A Heideggerian\nhermeneutic phenomenological approach was used. Twenty UK\nparticipants were purposively selected and interviewed.\nFindings from the initial sample of 10 women who were pregnant\nin 2012 indicated that virtual media was a primary source of\nbirth stories. This led to recruitment of a second sample of\n10 women who gave birth in the 1970s-1980s, to determine\nwhether they were more able to translate information into\nknowledge via stories told through personal contact and not\nthrough virtual technologies. RESULTS: Findings revealed the\nexperience of 'being-in-the-world' of birth and of stories in\nthat world. From a Heideggerian perspective, the birth story\nwas constructed through 'idle talk' (the taken for granted\nassumptions of things, which come into being through\nlanguage). Both oral stories and those told through technology\nwere described as the 'modern birth story'. The first theme\n'Stories are difficult like that', examines the birth story as\nproblematic and considers how stories shape meaning. The\nsecond 'It's a generational thing', considers how women from\ntwo generations came to understand what their experience might\nbe. The third 'Birth in the twilight of certainty,' examines\nwomen's experience of Being in a system of birth as\nconstructed, portrayed and sustained in the stories being\nshared. CONCLUSIONS: The women pregnant in 2012 framed their\nexpectations in the language of choice, whilst the women who\nbirthed in the 1970s-1980s framed their experience in the\nlanguage of safety. For both, however, the world of birth was\nthe same; saturated with, and only legitimised by the birth of\na healthy baby.

Outpatient clinical notes document\ncare, communicate treatment plans and support patient safety,\nmedical education, medico-legal investigations and\nreimbursement. Accurately describing and assessing quality of\nclinical documentation is a necessary improvement in an\nincreasingly team-based healthcare delivery system. In this\npaper we describe the quality of outpatient clinical notes\nfrom the perspective of multiple stakeholders. METHODS: Using\npurposeful sampling for maximum diversity, we conducted focus\ngroups and individual interviews with clinicians, nursing and\nancillary staff, patients, and healthcare administrators at\nsix federal health care facilities between 2009 and 2011. All\nsessions were audio-recorded, transcribed and qualitatively\nanalyzed using open, axial and selective coding.

Three\norganizing themes emerged: 1) characteristics of quality in\nclinical notes, 2) desired elements within the clinical notes\nand 3) system supports to improve the quality of clinical\nnotes. We identified 11 codes to describe characteristics of\nclinical notes, 20 codes to describe desired elements in\nquality clinical notes and 11 codes to describe clinical\nsystem elements that support quality when writing clinical\nnotes. While there was substantial overlap between the aspects\nof quality described by the four stakeholder groups, only\nclinicians and administrators identified ease of translation\ninto billing codes as an important characteristic of a quality\nnote. Only patients rated prioritization of their medical\nproblems as an aspect of quality.

Thus, narrative-motifs expose\ncommonalities between multiple conspiracy theories even when\nthey refer to different events or circumstances.

We found that most players\nenjoyed and appreciated experiencing negatively valenced\nemotions, such as sadness.

To support web\nsearch with this deeper level of understanding, a web-scale\nentity linking system must have 3 key properties: First, its\nfeature extraction must be robust to the diversity of web\ndocuments and their var- ied writing styles and content\nstructures. Second, it must maintain high-precision linking for\n``tail'' (unpopular) entities that is robust to the existence of\nconfounding entities outside of the knowledge base and entity\nprofiles with minimal information. Finally, the system must\nrepresent large-scale knowledge bases with a scalable and\npowerful feature representation.

Here we\naim to characterise how users discuss the topic of miscarriage\nand preterm births on Twitter, analyse trends and drivers, and\ndescribe the perceived emotional state of women who have\nexperienced a miscarriage. METHODS: We obtained 291 443\nTwitter postings on miscarriages and preterm births from\nJanuary 2017 through December 2018. Latent Dirichlet\nAllocation (LDA) was used to identify major topics of\ndiscussion. We applied time series decomposition methods to\nassess temporal trends and identify major drivers of\ndiscussion. Furthermore, four coders labelled the emotional\ncontent of 7282 personal miscarriage disclosure tweets into\nthe following non-mutually exclusive categories:\ngrief/sadness/depression, anger, relief, isolation, annoyance,\nand neutral. RESULTS: Topics in our data fell into eight\ngroups: celebrity disclosures, Michelle Obama's disclosure,\npolitics, healthcare, preterm births, loss and anxiety, flu\nvaccine and ectopic pregnancies. Political discussions around\nmiscarriages were largely due to a misunderstanding between\nabortions and miscarriages.

Under this framework,\nwe introduce a wide range of composition models that we\nevaluate empirically on a phrase similarity task.", "keywords": "compositionality;2017 Combining Embeddings"}, {"title": "How To Analyze Political Attention With Minimal Assumptions And Costs", "authors": "Kevin M Quinn, Burt L Monroe, Colaresi  Michael And Crespin  Michael H, Dragomir R Radev", "year": "2010", "ref_id": "Quinn2010-sv", "link": "http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/j.1540-5907.2009.00427.x", "abstract": "Previous methods of analyzing the substance of political\nattention have had to make several restrictive assumptions or\nbeen prohibitively costly when applied to large-scale political\ntexts.

With pregnant women\nreportedly turning to the Internet for information during\npregnancy, a better understanding of this behavior is needed.\nThe objective of this study was to ascertain why and how\npregnant women use the Internet as a health information\nsource, and the overall effect it had on their decision\nmaking. Kuhlthau's (1993) information-seeking model was\nadapted to provide the underpinning theoretical framework for\nthe study. METHODS: The design was exploratory and\ndescriptive. Data were collected using a valid and reliable\nweb-based questionnaire. Over a 12-week period, 613 women from\n24 countries who had confirmed that they had used the Internet\nfor pregnancy-related information during their pregnancy\ncompleted and submitted a questionnaire. RESULTS: Most women\n(97\\%) used search engines such as Google to identify online\nweb pages to access a large variety of pregnancy-related\ninformation and to use the Internet for pregnancy-related\nsocial networking, support, and electronic commerce (i.e.,\ne-commerce). Almost 94 percent of women used the Internet to\nsupplement information already provided by health\nprofessionals and 83 percent used it to influence their\npregnancy decision making. Nearly half of the respondents\nreported dissatisfaction with information given by health\nprofessionals (48.6\\%) and lack of time to ask health\nprofessionals questions (46.5\\%) as key factors influencing\nthem to access the Internet. Statistically, women's confidence\nlevels significantly increased with respect to making\ndecisions about their pregnancy after Internet usage (p <\n0.05).

Conventional approaches on graph classification\nfocus on mining discriminative sub graph features under\nsupervised settings. The feature selection strategies strictly\nfollow the assumption that both positive and negative graphs\nexist. However, in many real-world applications, the negative\ngraph examples are not available. In this paper we study the\nproblem of how to select useful sub graph features and perform\ngraph classification based upon only positive and unlabeled\ngraphs. This problem is challenging and different from previous\nworks on PU learning, because there are no predefined features in\ngraph data. Moreover, the sub graph enumeration problem is\nNP-hard. We need to identify a subset of unlabeled graphs that\nare most likely to be negative graphs. However, the negative\ngraph selection problem and the sub graph feature selection\nproblem are correlated. Before the reliable negative graphs can\nbe resolved, we need to have a set of useful sub graph features.\nIn order to address this problem, we first derive an evaluation\ncriterion to estimate the dependency between sub graph features\nand class labels based on a set of estimated negative graphs.

Although social media, including Twitter,\nincreasingly influences reproductive-age individuals,\ndiscussion of contraception in this setting has yet to be\ncharacterized. Natural language processing, a type of machine\nlearning in which computers analyze natural language data,\nenables this analysis. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to\nilluminate temporal trends in attitudes toward long- and\nshort-acting reversible contraceptive methods in tweets\nbetween 2006 and 2019 and establish social media platforms as\nalternate data sources for large-scale sentiment analysis on\ncontraception. STUDY DESIGN: We studied English-language\ntweets mentioning reversible prescription contraceptive\nmethods between March 2006 (founding of Twitter) and December\n2019. Tweets mentioning contraception were extracted using\nsearch terms, including generic or brand names, colloquial\nnames, and abbreviations. We characterized and performed\nsentiment analysis on tweets. We used Mann-Kendall\nnonparametric tests to assess temporal trends in the overall\nnumber and the number of positive, negative, and neutral\ntweets referring to each method. The code to reproduce this\nanalysis is available at\nhttps://github.com/hms-dbmi/contraceptionOnTwitter. RESULTS:\nWe extracted 838,739 tweets mentioning at least 1\ncontraceptive method. The annual number of\ncontraception-related tweets increased considerably over the\nstudy period. The intrauterine device was the most commonly\nreferenced method (45.9\\%). Long-acting methods were mentioned\nmore often than short-acting ones (58\\% vs 42\\%), and the\nannual proportion of long-acting reversible\ncontraception-related tweets increased over time. In sentiment\nanalysis of tweets mentioning a single contraceptive method\n(n=665,064), the greatest proportion of all tweets was\nnegative (65,339 of 160,713 tweets with at least 95\\%\nconfident sentiment, or 40.66\\%). Tweets mentioning\nlong-acting methods were nearly twice as likely to be positive\ncompared with tweets mentioning short-acting methods (19.65\\%\nvs 10.21\\%; P<.002). CONCLUSION: Recognizing the influence of\nsocial networks on contraceptive decision making, social media\nplatforms may be useful in the collection and dissemination of\ninformation about contraception.", "keywords": "Twitter; birth control; contraception; long-acting reversible\ncontraception; natural language processing; sentiment\nanalysis; social media;birth-control;reproductive-healthcare"}, {"title": "An ED Scribe Program Is Able To Improve Throughput Time And Patient Satisfaction", "authors": "Aveh Bastani, Blerina Shaqiri, Palomba  Kristen And Bananno  Dominic, William Anderson", "year": "2014", "ref_id": "Bastani2014-ld", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ajem.2013.03.040", "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: At our institution, we previously described the\ndetrimental effect of computerized physician order entry\n(CPOE) on throughput time and patient satisfaction (Ann of\nEmer Med, Vol 56, P S83-S84).

The main focus is on two-way\nbilinear data analysis, but the results can easily be generalized\nto multiway data analysis. In fact, one of the scopes of this\npaper is to show that if two-way centering and scaling are\nunderstood, then multiway centering and scaling is quite\nstraightforward. In the literature it is often stated that\npreprocessing of multiway arrays is difficult, but here it is\nshown that most of the difficulties do not pertain to three- and\nhigher-way modeling in particular. It is shown that centering is\nmost conveniently seen as a projection step, where the data are\nprojected onto certain well-defined spaces within a given mode.\nThis view of centering helps to explain why, for example,\ncentering data with missing elements is likely to be suboptimal\nif there are many missing elements. Building a model for data\nconsists of two parts: postulating a structural model and using a\nmethod to estimate the parameters. Centering has to do with the\nfirst part: when centering, a model including offsets is\npostulated. Scaling has to do with the second part: when scaling,\nanother way of fitting the model is employed. It is shown that\ncentering is simply a convenient technique to estimate model\nparameters for models with certain offsets, but this does not\nwork for all types of offsets. It is also shown that scaling is a\nway to fit models with a weighted least squares loss function and\nthat sometimes this change in objective function cannot be\nperformed by a simple scaling step. Further practical aspects of\nand alternatives to centering and scaling are discussed, and\nexamples are used throughout to show that the conclusions in the\npaper are not only of theoretical interest but can have an impact\non practical data analysis.

Social\nnorms, information values, information behaviours, activities,\norganizations, and most notably community boundaries all have\nimportant sociotechnical impacts (Jaeger \\& Burnett, 2010; Meyer,\n2014; Sawyer \\& Jarrahi, 2014; Star \\& Griesemer, 1989),\nespecially when an online community is centred on information.\nWhen digital libraries take on social aspects, akin to other\ninformation-centric online communities, how they are used and the\nroles they play for users within and across the boundaries of\nsocial spaces require exploration and understanding (Lynch, 2005;\nMarshall \\& Bly, 2004; Star, Bowker, \\& Neumann, 2003; Van House,\n2003). They may act as boundary objects (Star \\& Griesemer,\n1989), facilitating the establishment of norms, values, and\nbehaviours between communities, or the emergence of new\ncommunities around their use (Star et al., 2003). However, our\nunderstanding is limited of how a social digital library and\ninformation-centric online community may act as a boundary object\nand whether it supports this establishment and emergence. A\nsignificant research gap exists in our understanding of the\nsystems, environments, and contexts at play around a social\ndigital library as a boundary object. This paper presents a\nmixed-methods study of LibraryThing (librarything.com) and\nGoodreads (goodreads.com), which share characteristics of both\ninformation-centric communities and social digital libraries. The\nstudy's objective was to examine the information values and\ninformation behaviour of users; the boundaries and boundary\nobjects at play; and the roles these sites play for users, as\nboundary objects themselves. Research questions asked about these\nroles and how they may or may not facilitate the processes of\ntranslation, coherence, and convergence---taken from boundary\nobject theory (Star \\& Griesemer, 1989; Star et al., 2003)---\nbetween existing and of emergent communities around LibraryThing\nand Goodreads. Findings from qualitative and quantitative\nmethods---including content analysis, a survey, and\nsemistructured interviews---show these two sites play three key\nroles for users, with translation an important activity. Clear\nimplications exist for design and practice in digital libraries\nand online communities, and for research on and theorizing of\nboundaries and boundary objects in such contexts. This paper\nbegins by reviewing relevant literature on online communities,\nsocial digital libraries, and boundaries and boundary objects,\nwith an eye to the unexplored overlaps between them.

Artificial\nintelligence (AI) assistants could potentially aid in creating\nanswers to patient questions by drafting responses that could\nbe reviewed by clinicians. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the ability\nof an AI chatbot assistant (ChatGPT), released in November\n2022, to provide quality and empathetic responses to patient\nquestions. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this\ncross-sectional study, a public and nonidentifiable database\nof questions from a public social media forum (Reddit's\nr/AskDocs) was used to randomly draw 195 exchanges from\nOctober 2022 where a verified physician responded to a public\nquestion. Chatbot responses were generated by entering the\noriginal question into a fresh session (without prior\nquestions having been asked in the session) on December 22 and\n23, 2022. The original question along with anonymized and\nrandomly ordered physician and chatbot responses were\nevaluated in triplicate by a team of licensed health care\nprofessionals. Evaluators chose ``which response was better''\nand judged both ``the quality of information provided'' (very\npoor, poor, acceptable, good, or very good) and ``the empathy\nor bedside manner provided'' (not empathetic, slightly\nempathetic, moderately empathetic, empathetic, and very\nempathetic). Mean outcomes were ordered on a 1 to 5 scale and\ncompared between chatbot and physicians. RESULTS: Of the 195\nquestions and responses, evaluators preferred chatbot\nresponses to physician responses in 78.6\\% (95\\% CI,\n75.0\\%-81.8\\%) of the 585 evaluations. Mean (IQR) physician\nresponses were significantly shorter than chatbot responses\n(52 [17-62] words vs 211 [168-245] words; t = 25.4; P < .001).\nChatbot responses were rated of significantly higher quality\nthan physician responses (t = 13.3; P < .001). The proportion\nof responses rated as good or very good quality ($\\geq$ 4),\nfor instance, was higher for chatbot than physicians (chatbot:\n78.5\\%, 95\\% CI, 72.3\\%-84.1\\%; physicians: 22.1\\%, 95\\% CI,\n16.4\\%-28.2\\%;). This amounted to 3.6 times higher prevalence\nof good or very good quality responses for the chatbot.\nChatbot responses were also rated significantly more\nempathetic than physician responses (t = 18.9; P < .001). The\nproportion of responses rated empathetic or very empathetic\n($\\geq$4) was higher for chatbot than for physicians\n(physicians: 4.6\\%, 95\\% CI, 2.1\\%-7.7\\%; chatbot: 45.1\\%,\n95\\% CI, 38.5\\%-51.8\\%; physicians: 4.6\\%, 95\\% CI,\n2.1\\%-7.7\\%). This amounted to 9.8 times higher prevalence of\nempathetic or very empathetic responses for the chatbot.\nCONCLUSIONS: In this cross-sectional study, a chatbot\ngenerated quality and empathetic responses to patient\nquestions posed in an online forum.

In the context\nof mitigating bias in occupation classification, we propose\na method for discouraging correlation between the predicted\nprobability of an individual's true occupation and a word\nembedding of their name.
