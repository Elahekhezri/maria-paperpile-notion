  abstract = "Wikification for tweets aims to automat- ically identify each
              concept mention in a tweet and link it to a concept referent in a
              knowledge base (e.g., Wikipedia). Due to the shortness of a
              tweet, a collective inference model incorporating global ev-
              idence from multiple mentions and con- cepts is more appropriate
              than a non- collecitve approach which links each men- tion at a
              time. In addition, it is chal- lenging to generate sufficient
              high quality labeled data for supervised models with low cost. To
              tackle these challenges, we propose a novel semi-supervised graph
              regularization model to incorporate both local and global
              evidence from multi- ple tweets through three fine-grained re-
              lations. In order to identify semantically- related mentions for
              collective inference, we detect meta path-based semantic rela-
              tions through social networks. Compared to the state-of-the-art
              supervised model trained from 100\% labeled data, our pro- posed
              approach achieves comparable per- formance with 31\% labeled data
              and ob- tains 5\% absolute F1 gain with 50\% la- beled data.",
