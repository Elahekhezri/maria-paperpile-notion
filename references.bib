                  116, 6720-6725 (2019)]. Norms were tighter in developed,
                  urbanized areas and weaker in rural areas. We tested whether
                  historical paddy rice farming has left a legacy on social
                  norms in modern China. Premodern rice farming could plausibly
                  create strong social norms because paddy rice relied on
                  irrigation networks. Rice farmers coordinated their water use
                  and kept track of each person's labor contributions. Rice
                  villages also established strong norms of reciprocity to cope
                  with labor demands that were twice as high as dryland crops
                  like wheat. In line with this theory, China's historically
                  rice-farming areas had tighter social norms than wheat-farming
                  areas, even beyond differences in development and
                  urbanization. Rice-wheat differences were just as large among
                  people in 10 neighboring provinces (n = 3,835) along the
                  rice-wheat border. These neighboring provinces differ sharply
                  in rice and wheat, but little in latitude, temperature, and
                  other potential confounding variables. Outside of China, rice
                  farming predicted norm tightness in 32 countries around the
                  world. Finally, people in rice-farming areas scored lower on
                  innovative thinking, which tends to be lower in societies with
                  tight norms. This natural test case within China might explain
                  why East Asia-historically reliant on rice farming-has tighter
                  social norms than the wheat-farming West.},

                  psychology have evolved culturally over historical time. A
                  combination of approaches, including experimental data
                  collected over the past 75 years, cross-cultural comparisons,
                  and studies of immigrants, points to systematic changes in
                  psychological domains as diverse as conformity, attention,
                  emotion, morality, and olfaction. However, these approaches
                  can go back in time only for a few decades and typically fail
                  to provide continuous measures of cultural change, posing a
                  challenge for testing deeper historical psychological
                  processes. To tackle this challenge most directly,
                  computational methods emerging from natural language
                  processing can be adapted to extract psychological information
                  from large-scale historical corpora. Here, we first review the
                  benefits of psychology as a historical science and then
                  present three useful classes of text-analytic techniques for
                  historical psychological inquiry: dictionary-based methods,
                  distributed-representational methods, and
                  human-annotation-based methods. These represent an excellent
                  suite of methodologies that can be used to examine the record
                  of ?dead minds.? Finally, we discuss the importance of going
                  beyond English-centric text analysis in historical psychology
                  to foster a more generalizable and inclusive science of human
                  behavior. We propose that historical psychology should
                  incorporate and further develop a variety of text-analytic
                  approaches to reliably quantify the historical processes that
                  gave rise to contemporary social, political, and psychological
                  phenomena.}

                  ties, and residential mobility, fostered greater

                  behaviour of host populations. In humans (Homo sapiens), many
                  psychological phenomena appear to serve an antipathogen
                  defence function. One broad implication is the existence of
                  cross-cultural differences in human cognition and behaviour
                  contingent upon the relative presence of pathogens in the
                  local ecology. We focus specifically on one fundamental
                  cultural variable: differences in individualistic versus
                  collectivist values. We suggest that specific behavioural
                  manifestations of collectivism (e.g. ethnocentrism,
                  conformity) can inhibit the transmission of pathogens; and so
                  we hypothesize that collectivism (compared with individualism)
                  will more often characterize cultures in regions that have
                  historically had higher prevalence of pathogens. Drawing on
                  epidemiological data and the findings of worldwide
                  cross-national surveys of individualism/collectivism, our
                  results support this hypothesis: the regional prevalence of
                  pathogens has a strong positive correlation with cultural
                  indicators of collectivism and a strong negative correlation
                  with individualism. The correlations remain significant even
                  when controlling for potential confounding variables. These
                  results help to explain the origin of a paradigmatic
                  cross-cultural difference, and reveal previously undocumented
                  consequences of pathogenic diseases on the variable nature of

                  in countries such as the United States in the past several
                  decades. Although differences across societies and changes
                  within societies in gender equality have been well documented,
                  the causes of these changes remain poorly understood. Scholars
                  have posited that such shifts have been driven by specific
                  events (such as Title IX and Roe versus Wade), broader social
                  movements (such as feminism and women’s liberation) or general
                  levels of social development (for example, modernization
                  theory1). Although these factors are likely to have been
                  partly responsible for temporal variations in gender equality,
                  they provide fairly intermediate explanations void of a
                  comprehensive framework. Here, we use an ecological framework
                  to explore the role of key ecological dimensions on change in
                  gender equality over time. We focus on four key types of
                  ecological threats/affordances that have previously been
                  linked to cultural variations in human behaviour as potential
                  explanations for cultural change in gender equality:
                  infectious disease, resource scarcity, warfare and climatic
                  stress. We show that decreases in pathogen prevalence in the
                  United States over six decades (1951–2013) are linked to
                  reductions in gender inequality and that such shifts in rates
                  of infectious disease precede shifts in gender inequality.
                  Results were robust, holding when we controlled for other
                  ecological dimensions and for collectivism and conservative
                  ideological identification (indicators of more broadly
                  traditional cultural norms and attitudes). Furthermore, the
                  effects were partially mediated by reduced teenage birth rates
                  (a sign that people are adopting slower life history
                  strategies), suggesting that life history strategies
                  statistically account for the relationship between pathogen
                  prevalence and gender inequality over time. Finally, we
                  replicated our key effects in a different society, using
                  comparable data from the United Kingdom over a period of seven
                  decades (1945–2014).},
