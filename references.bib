               psychological variation around the globe but also highlights the
               peculiarity of many Western populations. We propose that part of
               this variation can be traced back to the action and diffusion of
               the Western Church, the branch of Christianity that evolved into
               the Roman Catholic Church. Specifically, we propose that the
               Western Church's transformation of European kinship, by promoting
               small, nuclear households, weak family ties, and residential
               mobility, fostered greater individualism, less conformity, and
               more impersonal prosociality. By combining data on 24
               psychological outcomes with historical measures of both Church
               exposure and kinship, we find support for these ideas in a
               comprehensive array of analyses across countries, among European
               regions, and among individuals from different cultural

               psychological phenomena appear to serve an antipathogen defence
               function. One broad implication is the existence of
               cross-cultural differences in human cognition and behaviour
               contingent upon the relative presence of pathogens in the local
               ecology. We focus specifically on one fundamental cultural
               variable: differences in individualistic versus collectivist
               values. We suggest that specific behavioural manifestations of
               collectivism (e.g. ethnocentrism, conformity) can inhibit the
               transmission of pathogens; and so we hypothesize that
               collectivism (compared with individualism) will more often
               characterize cultures in regions that have historically had
               higher prevalence of pathogens. Drawing on epidemiological data
               and the findings of worldwide cross-national surveys of
               individualism/collectivism, our results support this hypothesis:
               the regional prevalence of pathogens has a strong positive
               correlation with cultural indicators of collectivism and a strong
               negative correlation with individualism. The correlations remain
               significant even when controlling for potential confounding
               variables. These results help to explain the origin of a
               paradigmatic cross-cultural difference, and reveal previously
               undocumented consequences of pathogenic diseases on the variable
               nature of human societies.",

               (2019)]. Norms were tighter in developed, urbanized areas and
               weaker in rural areas. We tested whether historical paddy rice
               farming has left a legacy on social norms in modern China.
               Premodern rice farming could plausibly create strong social norms
               because paddy rice relied on irrigation networks. Rice farmers
               coordinated their water use and kept track of each person's labor
               contributions. Rice villages also established strong norms of
               reciprocity to cope with labor demands that were twice as high as
               dryland crops like wheat. In line with this theory, China's
               historically rice-farming areas had tighter social norms than
               wheat-farming areas, even beyond differences in development and
               urbanization. Rice-wheat differences were just as large among
               people in 10 neighboring provinces (n = 3,835) along the
               rice-wheat border. These neighboring provinces differ sharply in
               rice and wheat, but little in latitude, temperature, and other
               potential confounding variables. Outside of China, rice farming
               predicted norm tightness in 32 countries around the world.
               Finally, people in rice-farming areas scored lower on innovative
               thinking, which tends to be lower in societies with tight norms.
               This natural test case within China might explain why East
               Asia-historically reliant on rice farming-has tighter social
               norms than the wheat-farming West.",

  abstract  = "Gender equality has varied across time, with dramatic shifts in
               countries such as the United States in the past several decades.
               Although differences across societies and changes within
               societies in gender equality have been well documented, the
               causes of these changes remain poorly understood. Scholars have
               posited that such shifts have been driven by specific events
               (such as Title IX and Roe versus Wade), broader social movements
               (such as feminism and women’s liberation) or general levels of
               social development (for example, modernization theory1). Although
               these factors are likely to have been partly responsible for
               temporal variations in gender equality, they provide fairly
               intermediate explanations void of a comprehensive framework.
               Here, we use an ecological framework to explore the role of key
               ecological dimensions on change in gender equality over time. We
               focus on four key types of ecological threats/affordances that
               have previously been linked to cultural variations in human
               behaviour as potential explanations for cultural change in gender
               equality: infectious disease, resource scarcity, warfare and
               climatic stress. We show that decreases in pathogen prevalence in
               the United States over six decades (1951–2013) are linked to
               reductions in gender inequality and that such shifts in rates of
               infectious disease precede shifts in gender inequality. Results
               were robust, holding when we controlled for other ecological
               dimensions and for collectivism and conservative ideological
               identification (indicators of more broadly traditional cultural
               norms and attitudes). Furthermore, the effects were partially
               mediated by reduced teenage birth rates (a sign that people are
               adopting slower life history strategies), suggesting that life
               history strategies statistically account for the relationship
               between pathogen prevalence and gender inequality over time.
               Finally, we replicated our key effects in a different society,
               using comparable data from the United Kingdom over a period of
               seven decades (1945–2014).",
