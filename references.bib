                   ratable aspects of objects from online user reviews.
                   Extracting such aspects is an important challenge in
                   automatically mining product opinions from the web and in
                   generating opinion-based summaries of user reviews. Our
                   models are based on extensions to standard topic modeling
                   methods such as LDA and PLSA to induce multi-grain topics. We
                   argue that multi-grain models are more appropriate for our
                   task since standard models tend to produce topics that
                   correspond to global properties of objects (e.g., the brand
                   of a product type) rather than the aspects of an object that
                   tend to be rated by a user. The models we present not only
                   extract ratable aspects, but also cluster them into coherent
                   topics, e.g., `waitress' and `bartender' are part of the same
                   topic `staff' for restaurants. This differentiates it from
                   much of the previous work which extracts aspects through term
                   frequency analysis with minimal clustering. We evaluate the
                   multi-grain models both qualitatively and quantitatively to
                   show that they improve significantly upon standard topic
                   models.",

  abstract = "There are many on-line settings in which users publicly express
              opinions. A number of these offer mechanisms for other users to
              evaluate these opinions; a canonical example is Amazon.com, where
              reviews come with annotations like ``26 of 32 people found the
              following review helpful.'' Opinion evaluation appears in many
              off-line settings as well, including market research and political
              campaigns. Reasoning about the evaluation of an opinion is
              fundamentally different from reasoning about the opinion itself:
              rather than asking, ``What did Y think of X?'', we are asking,
              ``What did Z think of Y's opinion of X?'' Here we develop a
              framework for analyzing and modeling opinion evaluation, using a
              large-scale collection of Amazon book reviews as a dataset. We
              find that the perceived helpfulness of a review depends not just
              on its content but also but also in subtle ways on how the
              expressed evaluation relates to other evaluations of the same
              product. As part of our approach, we develop novel methods that
              take advantage of the phenomenon of review ``plagiarism'' to
              control for the effects of text in opinion evaluation, and we
              provide a simple and natural mathematical model consistent with
              our findings. Our analysis also allows us to distinguish among the
              predictions of competing theories from sociology and social
              psychology, and to discover unexpected differences in the
              collective opinion-evaluation behavior of user populations from

              ties, and word of mouth has an important impact on consumer
              behavior. But what drives interpersonal communication and why do
              people talk about certain things rather than others? This article
              argues that word of mouth is goal driven and serves five key
              functions (i.e., impression management, emotion regulation,
              information acquisition, social bonding, and persuasion).
              Importantly, I suggest these motivations are predominantly self-
              (rather than other) serving and drive what people talk about even
              without their awareness. Further, these drivers make predictions
              about the types of news and information people are most likely to
              discuss. This article reviews the five proposed functions and well
              as how contextual factors (i.e., audience and communication
              channel) may moderate which functions play a larger role. Taken
              together, the paper provides insight into the psychological
              factors that shape word of mouth and outlines additional questions

              This profoundly limits our ability to give instructions to
              computers, the ability of computers to explain their actions to
              us, and the ability of computers to analyse and process text.
              Vector space models (VSMs) of semantics are beginning to address
              these limits. This paper surveys the use of VSMs for semantic
              processing of text. We organize the literature on VSMs according
              to the structure of the matrix in a VSM. There are currently three
              broad classes of VSMs, based on term-document, word-context, and
              pair-pattern matrices, yielding three classes of applications. We
              survey a broad range of applications in these three categories and
              we take a detailed look at a specific open source project in each
              category. Our goal in this survey is to show the breadth of
              applications of VSMs for semantics, to provide a new perspective
              on VSMs for those who are already familiar with the area, and to

              least-squares fitting is only appropriate when there is a
              dimension along which the data points have negligible
              uncertainties, and another along which all the uncertainties can

              referred to as PU learning, differs from the standard supervised
              classification problem by the lack of negative examples in the
              training set. It corresponds to an ubiquitous situation in many
              applications such as information retrieval or gene ranking, when
              we have identified a set of data of interest sharing a particular
              property, and we wish to automatically retrieve additional data
              sharing the same property among a large and easily available pool
              of unlabeled data. We propose a new method for PU learning with a
              conceptually simple implementation based on bootstrap aggregating
              (bagging) techniques: the algorithm iteratively trains many binary
              classifiers to discriminate the known positive examples from
              random subsamples of the unlabeled set, and averages their
              predictions. We show theoretically and experimentally that the
              method can match and even outperform the performance of
              state-of-the-art methods for PU learning, particularly when the
              number of positive examples is limited and the fraction of
              negatives among the unlabeled examples is small. The proposed

              accounts for the general observation that participants in
              conversations tend to converge to one another's communicative
              behavior: they coordinate in a variety of dimensions including
              choice of words, syntax, utterance length, pitch and gestures. In
              its almost forty years of existence, this theory has been
              empirically supported exclusively through small-scale or
              controlled laboratory studies. Here we address this phenomenon in
              the context of Twitter conversations. Undoubtedly, this setting is
              unlike any other in which accommodation was observed and, thus,
              challenging to the theory. Its novelty comes not only from its
              size, but also from the non real-time nature of conversations,
              from the 140 character length restriction, from the wide variety
              of social relation types, and from a design that was initially not
              geared towards conversation at all. Given such constraints, it is
              not clear a priori whether accommodation is robust enough to occur
              given the constraints of this new environment. To investigate
              this, we develop a probabilistic framework that can model
              accommodation and measure its effects. We apply it to a large
              Twitter conversational dataset specifically developed for this
              task. This is the first time the hypothesis of linguistic style
              accommodation has been examined (and verified) in a large scale,
              real world setting. Furthermore, when investigating concepts such
              as stylistic influence and symmetry of accommodation, we discover
              a complexity of the phenomenon which was never observed before. We
              also explore the potential relation between stylistic influence
              and network features commonly associated with social status.",

              larger network structures. The interactions themselves, however,
              generally take place in the form of natural language --- either
              spoken or written --- and one could reasonably suppose that
              signals manifested in language might also provide information
              about roles, status, and other aspects of the group's dynamics. To
              date, however, finding such domain-independent language-based
              signals has been a challenge. Here, we show that in group
              discussions power differentials between participants are subtly
              revealed by how much one individual immediately echoes the
              linguistic style of the person they are responding to. Starting
              from this observation, we propose an analysis framework based on
              linguistic coordination that can be used to shed light on power
              relationships and that works consistently across multiple types of
              power --- including a more ``static'' form of power based on
              status differences, and a more ``situational'' form of power in
              which one individual experiences a type of dependence on another.
              Using this framework, we study how conversational behavior can
              reveal power relationships in two very different settings:

              In the quantification of information created by Claude Shannon,
              when he was working at AT\&T (see Ref. [1]), what you tell me--the
              information--is associated with the outcome of a random, or
              quasi-random, process. For example, if I flip a coin, the outcome
              of that toss is something you might want to know.1 Information
              theory is fundamentally about signals, not the meaning they carry.
              What we mea- sure thus requires interpretation. Conversely, in its

              using social networks like Twitter, Facebook, and Foursquare to
              spread phishing scams. Twitter is an immensely popular
              micro-blogging network where people post short messages of 140
              characters called tweets. It has over 100 million active users who
              post about 200 million tweets everyday. Phishers have started
              using Twitter as a medium to spread phishing because of this vast
              information dissemination. Further, it is difficult to detect
              phishing on Twitter unlike emails because of the quick spread of
              phishing links in the network, short size of the content, and use
              of URL obfuscation to shorten the URL. Our technique, PhishAri,
              detects phishing on Twitter in realtime. We use Twitter specific
              features along with URL features to detect whether a tweet posted
              with a URL is phishing or not. Some of the Twitter specific
              features we use are tweet content and its characteristics like
              length, hashtags, and mentions. Other Twitter features used are
              the characteristics of the Twitter user posting the tweet such as
              age of the account, number of tweets, and the follower-followee
              ratio. These twitter specific features coupled with URL based
              features prove to be a strong mechanism to detect phishing tweets.
              We use machine learning classification techniques and detect
              phishing tweets with an accuracy of 92.52\%. We have deployed our
              system for end-users by providing an easy to use Chrome browser
              extension. The extension works in realtime and classifies a tweet
              as phishing or safe. In this research, we show that we are able to
              detect phishing tweets at zero hour with high accuracy which is
              much faster than public blacklists and as well as Twitter's own
              defense mechanism to detect malicious content. We also performed a
              quick user evaluation of PhishAri in a laboratory study to
              evaluate the usability and effectiveness of PhishAri and showed
              that users like and find it convenient to use PhishAri in

              Seven Samurai simply because a user enjoys other action movies;
              rather, we might conclude that they will eventually enjoy it--once

               (e.g., books, users or songs) on the Web. Yet, previous research
               has provided interesting evidence that the tag distributions of
               resources may become semantically stable over time as more and
               more users tag them. At the same time, previous work has raised
               an array of new questions such as: (i) How can we assess the
               semantic stability of social tagging systems in a robust and
               methodical way? (ii) Does semantic stabilization of tags vary

               what are the factors that can explain semantic stabilization in
               such systems? In this work we tackle these questions by (i)
               presenting a novel and robust method which overcomes a number of
               limitations in existing methods, (ii) empirically investigating

  abstract = "Deep neural networks are highly expressive models that have
              recently achieved state of the art performance on speech and
              visual recognition tasks. While their expressiveness is the reason
              they succeed, it also causes them to learn uninter- pretable
              solutions that could have counter-intuitive properties. In this
              paper we report two such properties. First, we find that there is
              no distinction between individual high level units and random
              linear combinations of high level units, according to various
              methods of unit analysis. It suggests that it is the space, rather
              than the individual units, that contains the semantic information
              in the high layers of neural networks. Second, we find that deep
              neural networks learn input-output mappings that are fairly
              discontinuous to a significant extent. We can cause the network to
              misclas- sify an image by applying a certain hardly perceptible
              perturbation, which is found by maximizing the network's
              prediction error. In addition, the specific nature of these
              perturbations is not a random artifact of learning: the same
              perturbation can cause a different network, that was trained on a
              different subset of the dataset, to misclassify the same input.",

  abstract = "Investigation of the underlying physics or biology from empirical
              data requires a quantifiable notion of similarity - when do two
              observed data sets indicate nearly identical generating processes,
              and when they do not. The discriminating characteristics to look
              for in data is often determined by heuristics designed by experts,
              e.g., distinct shapes of ``folded'' lightcurves may be used as
              ``features'' to classify variable stars, while determination of
              pathological brain states might require a Fourier analysis of
              brainwave activity. Finding good features is non-trivial. Here, we
              propose a universal solution to this problem: we delineate a
              principle for quantifying similarity between sources of arbitrary
              data streams, without a priori knowledge, features or training. We
              uncover an algebraic structure on a space of symbolic models for
              quantized data, and show that such stochastic generators may be
              added and uniquely inverted; and that a model and its inverse
              always sum to the generator of flat white noise. Therefore, every
              data stream has an anti-stream: data generated by the inverse
              model. Similarity between two streams, then, is the degree to
              which one, when summed to the other's anti-stream, mutually
              annihilates all statistical structure to noise. We call this data
              smashing. We present diverse applications, including
              disambiguation of brainwaves pertaining to epileptic seizures,
              detection of anomalous cardiac rhythms, and classification of
              astronomical objects from raw photometry. In our examples, the
              data smashing principle, without access to any domain knowledge,
              meets or exceeds the performance of specialized algorithms tuned

              are almost ubiquitously used to perform such minimizations, and it
              is often thought that a main source of difficulty for these local
              methods to find the global minimum is the proliferation of local
              minima with much higher error than the global minimum. Here we
              argue, based on results from statistical physics, random matrix
              theory, neural network theory, and empirical evidence, that a
              deeper and more profound difficulty originates from the
              proliferation of saddle points, not local minima, especially in
              high dimensional problems of practical interest. Such saddle
              points are surrounded by high error plateaus that can dramatically
              slow down learning, and give the illusory impression of the
              existence of a local minimum. Motivated by these arguments, we
              propose a new approach to second-order optimization, the
              saddle-free Newton method, that can rapidly escape high
              dimensional saddle points, unlike gradient descent and
              quasi-Newton methods. We apply this algorithm to deep or recurrent

              bounds known for the problem of computing edit distance might be
              tight. Specifically, we show that, if the edit distance can be
              computed in time O(n 2-$\delta$) for some constant $\delta$ > 0,
              then the satisfiability of conjunctive normal form formulas with N

              Tidy datasets are easy to manipulate, model and visualize, and
              have a specific structure: each variable is a column, each
              observation is a row, and each type of observational unit is a
              table. This framework makes it easy to tidy messy datasets because
              only a small set of tools are needed to deal with a wide range of
              un-tidy datasets. This structure also makes it easier to develop
              tidy tools for data analysis, tools that both input and output
              tidy datasets. The advantages of a consistent data structure and
              matching tools are demonstrated with a case study free from

              an active and rich research domain, people usually interact with
              multiple communities both on- and off-line. How do users act in
              such multi-community environments? Although there are a host of
              intriguing aspects to this question, it has received much less
              attention in the research community in comparison to the
              intra-community case. In this paper, we examine three aspects of
              multi-community engagement: the sequence of communities that users
              post to, the language that users employ in those communities, and
              the feedback that users receive, using longitudinal posting
              behavior on Reddit as our main data source, and DBLP for auxiliary
              experiments. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of features
              drawn from these aspects in predicting users' future level of
              activity. One might expect that a user's trajectory mimics the
              ``settling-down'' process in real life: an initial exploration of
              sub-communities before settling down into a few niches. However,
              we find that the users in our data continually post in new
              communities; moreover, as time goes on, they post increasingly
              evenly among a more diverse set of smaller communities.
              Interestingly, it seems that users that eventually leave the
              community are ``destined'' to do so from the very beginning, in
              the sense of showing significantly different ``wandering''
              patterns very early on in their trajectories; this finding has
              potentially important design implications for community
              maintainers. Our multi-community perspective also allows us to
              investigate the ``situation vs. personality'' debate from language
              usage across different communities.",

              Processing (NLP) tasks due to their ability to efficiently model
              complex semantic and syntactic word relationships. However, most
              techniques model only one representation per word, despite the
              fact that a single word can have multiple meanings or ``senses''.
              Some techniques model words by using multiple vectors that are
              clustered based on context. However, recent neural approaches
              rarely focus on the application to a consuming NLP algorithm.
              Furthermore, the training process of recent word-sense models is
              expensive relative to single-sense embedding processes. This paper
              presents a novel approach which addresses these concerns by
              modeling multiple embeddings for each word based on supervised
              disambiguation, which provides a fast and accurate way for a
              consuming NLP model to select a sense-disambiguated embedding. We
              demonstrate that these embeddings can disambiguate both
              contrastive senses such as nominal and verbal senses as well as
              nuanced senses such as sarcasm. We further evaluate Part-of-Speech
              disambiguated embeddings on neural dependency parsing, yielding a
              greater than 8\% average error reduction in unlabeled attachment
              scores across 6 languages.",

              policy choices seem to depend on understanding the
              counterfactual-- what happens with and without a policy--this
              tight link of causality and policy seems natural. While this link
              holds in many cases, we argue that there are also many policy
              applications where causal inference is not central, or even
              necessary. Consider two toy examples. One policymaker facing a
              drought must decide whether to invest in a rain dance to increase
              the chance of rain. Another seeing clouds must decide whether to
              take an umbrella to work to avoid getting wet on the way home.
              Both decisions could benefit from an empirical study of rain. But
              each has differ-ent requirements of the estimator. One requires
              causality: Do rain dances cause rain? The other does not, needing
              only prediction: Is the chance of rain high enough to merit an
              umbrella? We often focus on rain dance--like policy problems. But
              there are also many umbrella-like policy problems. Not only are
              these prediction prob-lems neglected, machine learning can help us
              solve them more effectively. In this paper, we (i) provide a
              simple frame-work that clarifies the distinction between causation
              and prediction; (ii) explain how machine learning adds value over
              traditional regression approaches in solving prediction problems;
              (iii) provide an empirical example from health policy to
              illustrate how improved predictions can generate large social
              impact; (iv) illustrate how `` umbrella '' problems are common and
              important in many important pol-icy domains; and (v) argue that
              solving these problems produces not just policy impact but also
              theoretical and economic insights. 1 I. Prediction and Causation
              Let Y be an outcome variable (such as rain) which depends in an
              unknown way on a set of variables X 0 and X . A policymaker must
              decide on X 0 (e.g., an umbrella or rain dance) in order to
              maximize a (known) payoff function $\pi$(X 0 , Y) . Our decision
              of X 0 depends on the derivative d$\pi$(X 0 , Y)",

                   approximate difficult-to-compute probability densities. This

                   frames all inference about unknown quantities as a
                   calculation involving the posterior density. In this paper,
                   we review variational inference (VI), a method from machine
                   learning that approximates probability densities through
                   optimization. VI has been used in many applications and tends
                   to be faster than classical methods, such as Markov chain
                   Monte Carlo sampling. The idea behind VI is to first posit a
                   family of densities and then to find the member of that
                   family which is close to the target. Closeness is measured by

  abstract = "Changing someone's opinion is arguably one of the most important
              challenges of social interaction. The underlying process proves
              difficult to study: it is hard to know how someone's opinions are
              formed and whether and how someone's views shift. Fortunately,
              ChangeMyView, an active community on Reddit, provides a platform
              where users present their own opinions and reasoning, invite
              others to contest them, and acknowledge when the ensuing
              discussions change their original views. In this work, we study
              these interactions to understand the mechanisms behind persuasion.
              We find that persuasive arguments are characterized by interesting
              patterns of interaction dynamics, such as participant entry-order
              and degree of back-and-forth exchange. Furthermore, by comparing
              similar counterarguments to the same opinion, we show that
              language factors play an essential role. In particular, the
              interplay between the language of the opinion holder and that of
              the counterargument provides highly predictive cues of
              persuasiveness. Finally, since even in this favorable setting
              people may not be persuaded, we investigate the problem of
              determining whether someone's opinion is susceptible to being

              factorization of the point-wise mutual information matrix via

              handling for unobserved co-occurrences, and thus makes use of all

              proportional to the size of the entire matrix, we make use of
              vectorized multiplication to process thousands of rows and columns

              partition the matrix into shards in order to parallelize the

              supervised learning methods and are key enablers of deep learning
              techniques. For some applications, creating labeled training sets
              is the most time-consuming and expensive part of applying machine
              learning. We therefore propose a paradigm for the programmatic
              creation of training sets called data programming in which users
              provide a set of labeling functions, which are programs that
              heuristically label large subsets of data points, albeit noisily.
              By viewing these labeling functions as implicitly describing a
              generative model for this noise, we show that we can recover the
              parameters of this model to ``denoise'' the training set. Then, we
              show how to modify a discriminative loss function to make it
              noise-aware. We demonstrate our method over a range of
              discriminative models including logistic regression and LSTMs. We
              establish theoretically that we can recover the parameters of
              these generative models in a handful of settings. Experimentally,
              on the 2014 TAC-KBP relation extraction challenge, we show that
              data programming would have obtained a winning score, and also
              show that applying data programming to an LSTM model leads to a
              TAC-KBP score almost 6 F1 points over a supervised LSTM baseline
              (and into second place in the competition). Additionally, in

                   set (sentence IDs) accounts for a significant performance gap
                   among these algorithms. This feature set is also used by
                   traditional alignment algorithms, such as IBM Model-1, which
                   demonstrate similar performance to state-of-the-art embedding
                   algorithms on a variety of benchmarks. Overall, we observe
                   that different algorithmic approaches for utilizing the
                   sentence ID feature space result in similar performance. This
                   paper draws both empirical and theoretical parallels between
                   the embedding and alignment literature, and suggests that
                   adding additional sources of information, which go beyond the
                   traditional signal of bilingual sentence-aligned corpora, may
                   substantially improve cross-lingual word embeddings, and that
                   future baselines should at least take such features into
                   account.",

                   The reason for this problem is obvious: NLP models are
                   trained on samples from a limited set of canonical varieties
                   that are considered standard, most prominently English
                   newswire. However, there are many dimensions, e.g.,
                   socio-demographics, language, genre, sentence type, etc. on
                   which texts can differ from the standard. The solution is not
                   obvious: we cannot control for all factors, and it is not
                   clear how to best go beyond the current practice of training
                   on homogeneous data from a single domain and language. In
                   this paper, I review the notion of canonicity, and how it
                   shapes our community's approach to language. I argue for
                   leveraging what I call fortuitous data, i.e., non-obvious
                   data that is hitherto neglected, hidden in plain sight, or
                   raw data that needs to be refined. If we embrace the variety
                   of this heterogeneous data by combining it with proper
                   algorithms, we will not only produce more robust models, but

              understand which algorithms perform well on which measure(s) and

              incorporating word-level domain knowledge into CorEx by
              introducing anchor words in a manner reminiscent of the

              the topic model to be guided with minimal human intervention
              towards topics that do not naturally emerge. Furthermore, we show
              that these new topics are often highly coherent and act as better

              uncover the argument structure present in argumentative text. In
              order to determine this structure, one must understand how
              different individual components of the overall argument are
              linked. General consensus in this field dictates that the argument
              components form a hierarchy of persuasion, which manifests itself
              in a tree structure. This work provides the first neural
              network-based approach to argumentation mining, focusing on the
              two tasks of extracting links between argument components, and
              classifying types of argument components. In order to solve this
              problem, we propose to use a joint model that is based on a
              Pointer Network architecture. A Pointer Network is appealing for
              this task for the following reasons: 1) It takes into account the
              sequential nature of argument components; 2) By construction, it
              enforces certain properties of the tree structure present in
              argument relations; 3) The hidden representations can be applied
              to auxiliary tasks. In order to extend the contribution of the
              original Pointer Network model, we construct a joint model that
              simultaneously attempts to learn the type of argument component,
              as well as continuing to predict links between argument
              components. The proposed joint model achieves state-of-the-art
              results on two separate evaluation corpora, achieving far superior
              performance than a regular Pointer Network model. Our results show
              that optimizing for both tasks, and adding a fully-connected layer
              prior to recurrent neural network input, is crucial for high
              performance.",

  abstract      = "In many domains, a latent competition among different
                   conventions determines which one will come to dominate. One
                   sees such effects in the success of community jargon, of
                   competing frames in political rhetoric, or of terminology in
                   technical contexts. These effects have become widespread in
                   the online domain, where the data offers the potential to
                   study competition among conventions at a fine-grained level.
                   In analyzing the dynamics of conventions over time, however,
                   even with detailed on-line data, one encounters two
                   significant challenges. First, as conventions evolve, the
                   underlying substance of their meaning tends to change as
                   well; and such substantive changes confound investigations of
                   social effects. Second, the selection of a convention takes
                   place through the complex interactions of individuals within
                   a community, and contention between the users of competing
                   conventions plays a key role in the convention's evolution.
                   Any analysis must take place in the presence of these two
                   issues. In this work we study a setting in which we can
                   cleanly track the competition among conventions. Our analysis
                   is based on the spread of low-level authoring conventions in
                   the eprint arXiv over 24 years: by tracking the spread of
                   macros and other author-defined conventions, we are able to
                   study conventions that vary even as the underlying meaning
                   remains constant. We find that the interaction among
                   co-authors over time plays a crucial role in the selection of
                   them; the distinction between more and less experienced
                   members of the community, and the distinction between
                   conventions with visible versus invisible effects, are both
                   central to the underlying processes. Through our analysis we
                   make predictions at the population level about the ultimate
                   success of different synonymous conventions over time--and at
                   the individual level about the outcome of ``fights'' between
                   people over convention choices.",

              embedding vectors are inferred from a probabilistic version of
              word2vec [Mikolov, 2013]. These embedding vectors are connected in
              time through a latent diffusion process. We describe two scalable
              variational inference algorithms---skip-gram smoothing and
              skip-gram filtering---that allow us to train the model jointly
              over all times; thus learning on all data while simultaneously
              allowing word and context vectors to drift. Experimental results
              on three different corpora demonstrate that our dynamic model
              infers word embedding trajectories that are more interpretable and
              lead to higher predictive likelihoods than competing methods that
              are based on static models trained separately on time slices.",

              In this work we provide a systematic exploration of the nature of
              this relation across a wide variety of online communities. To this
              end we introduce a quantitative, language-based typology
              reflecting two key aspects of a community's identity: how
              distinctive, and how temporally dynamic it is. By mapping almost
              300 Reddit communities into the landscape induced by this
              typology, we reveal regularities in how patterns of user

              results suggest that the way new and existing users engage with a
              community depends strongly and systematically on the nature of the
              collective identity it fosters, in ways that are highly
              consequential to community maintainers. For example, communities
              with distinctive and highly dynamic identities are more likely to
              retain their users. However, such niche communities also exhibit
              much larger acculturation gaps between existing users and
              newcomers, which potentially hinder the integration of the latter.
              More generally, our methodology reveals differences in how various

  abstract = "Deep Learning has revolutionized vision via convolutional neural
              networks (CNNs) and natural language processing via recurrent
              neural networks (RNNs). However, success stories of Deep Learning
              with standard feed-forward neural networks (FNNs) are rare. FNNs
              that perform well are typically shallow and, therefore cannot
              exploit many levels of abstract representations. We introduce
              self-normalizing neural networks (SNNs) to enable high-level
              abstract representations. While batch normalization requires
              explicit normalization, neuron activations of SNNs automatically
              converge towards zero mean and unit variance. The activation
              function of SNNs are ``scaled exponential linear units'' (SELUs),
              which induce self-normalizing properties. Using the Banach
              fixed-point theorem, we prove that activations close to zero mean
              and unit variance that are propagated through many network layers
              will converge towards zero mean and unit variance -- even under
              the presence of noise and perturbations. This convergence property
              of SNNs allows to (1) train deep networks with many layers, (2)
              employ strong regularization, and (3) to make learning highly
              robust. Furthermore, for activations not close to unit variance,
              we prove an upper and lower bound on the variance, thus, vanishing
              and exploding gradients are impossible. We compared SNNs on (a)
              121 tasks from the UCI machine learning repository, on (b) drug
              discovery benchmarks, and on (c) astronomy tasks with standard
              FNNs and other machine learning methods such as random forests and
              support vector machines. SNNs significantly outperformed all
              competing FNN methods at 121 UCI tasks, outperformed all competing
              methods at the Tox21 dataset, and set a new record at an astronomy
              data set. The winning SNN architectures are often very deep.

                 experiment, which demonstrates how detailed records of behavior
                 can improve studies of social influence, information diffusion,
                 and imitation. Abstract Peer effects, in which an individual's
                 behavior is affected by peers' behavior, are posited by
                 multiple theories in the social sciences. Randomized field
                 experiments that identify peer effects, however, are often
                 expensive or infeasible, so many studies of peer effects use
                 observational data, which is expected to suffer from
                 confounding. Here we show, in the context of information and
                 media diffusion, that high-dimensional adjustment of a
                 nonexperimental control group (660 million observations) using
                 propensity score models produces estimates of peer effects
                 statistically indistinguishable from those using a large
                 randomized experiment (215 million observations). Compared with
                 the experiment, naive observational estimators overstate peer
                 effects by over 300\% and commonly available variables (e.g.,
                 demographics) offer little bias reduction. Adjusting for a
                 measure of prior behaviors closely related to the focal
                 behavior reduces this bias by 91\%, while models adjusting for
                 over 3700 past behaviors provide additional bias reduction,
                 reducing bias by over 97\%, which is statistically
                 indistinguishable from unbiasedness. This demonstrates how
                 detailed records of behavior can improve studies of social
                 influence, information diffusion, and imitation; these results
                 are encouraging for the credibility of some studies but also
                 cautionary for studies of peer effects in rare or new
                 behaviors. More generally, these results show how large,

  abstract      = "The assumption that data samples are independently
                   identically distributed is the backbone of many learning
                   algorithms. Nevertheless, datasets often exhibit rich
                   structures in practice, and we argue that there exist some
                   unknown orders within the data instances. Aiming to find such
                   orders, we introduce a novel Generative Markov Network (GMN)
                   which we use to extract the order of data instances
                   automatically. Specifically, we assume that the instances are
                   sampled from a Markov chain. Our goal is to learn the
                   transitional operator of the chain as well as the generation
                   order by maximizing the generation probability under all
                   possible data permutations. One of our key ideas is to use
                   neural networks as a soft lookup table for approximating the
                   possibly huge, but discrete transition matrix. This strategy
                   allows us to amortize the space complexity with a single
                   model and make the transitional operator generalizable to
                   unseen instances. To ensure the learned Markov chain is
                   ergodic, we propose a greedy batch-wise permutation scheme
                   that allows fast training. Empirically, we evaluate the
                   learned Markov chain by showing that GMNs are able to
                   discover orders among data instances and also perform
                   comparably well to state-of-the-art methods on the one-shot
                   recognition benchmark task.",

                   disparity have come to shape the study of fairness in
                   algorithmic decision-making. Algorithms exhibit treatment
                   disparity if they formally treat members of protected
                   subgroups differently; algorithms exhibit impact disparity
                   when outcomes differ across subgroups, even if the
                   correlation arises unintentionally. Naturally, we can achieve
                   impact parity through purposeful treatment disparity. In one
                   thread of technical work, papers aim to reconcile the two
                   forms of parity proposing disparate learning processes
                   (DLPs). Here, the learning algorithm can see group membership
                   during training but produce a classifier that is group-blind
                   at test time. In this paper, we show theoretically that: (i)
                   When other features correlate to group membership, DLPs will
                   (indirectly) implement treatment disparity, undermining the
                   policy desiderata they are designed to address; (ii) When
                   group membership is partly revealed by other features, DLPs
                   induce within-class discrimination; and (iii) In general,
                   DLPs provide a suboptimal trade-off between accuracy and
                   impact parity. Based on our technical analysis, we argue that
                   transparent treatment disparity is preferable to occluded
                   methods for achieving impact parity. Experimental results on
                   several real-world datasets highlight the practical
                   consequences of applying DLPs vs. per-group thresholds.",

                   many core areas in language understanding. Scripts were
                   proposed early on as a way of representing sequences of
                   events for such understanding, and has recently attracted
                   renewed attention. However, obtaining effective
                   representations for modeling script-like event sequences is
                   challenging. It requires representations that can capture
                   event-level and scenario-level semantics. We propose a new
                   tensor-based composition method for creating event
                   representations. The method captures more subtle semantic
                   interactions between an event and its entities and yields
                   representations that are effective at multiple event-related
                   tasks. With the continuous representations, we also devise a
                   simple schema generation method which produces better schemas
                   compared to a prior discrete representation based method. Our
                   analysis shows that the tensors capture distinct usages of a

                   of communities by tracing their early members' previous
                   community memberships. Our testbed is Reddit, a website that
                   consists of tens of thousands of user-created communities. We
                   analyze a dataset that spans over a decade and includes the
                   posting history of users on Reddit from its inception to
                   April 2017. We first propose a computational framework for
                   building genealogy graphs between communities. We present the
                   first large-scale characterization of such genealogy graphs.
                   Surprisingly, basic graph properties, such as the number of

                   community growth, confirming the importance of existing
                   community structures in which a new community emerges.

              These impact what users say, how they say it, and when they say

              to model the effect of the attacks on the volume and type of

              lead to an increase in online hate speech, particularly on
              messages directly advocating violence. Our research has

                   Medical records which are written by clinicians from
                   different specialties usually contain quite different
                   terminologies and writing styles. The difference of

                   particularly difficult to train a universal medical NER

                   transfer learning framework (La-DTL) for cross-specialty NER,
                   so that a medical NER system designed for one specialty could

                   approaches for building such representations that is based
                   upon recent theoretical results for GloVe-like embeddings.
                   Our method relies mainly on a linear transformation that is

                   features. This paper introduces a la carte embedding, a
                   simple and general alternative to the usual word2vec-based
                   approaches for building such representations that is based
                   upon recent theoretical results for GloVe-like embeddings.
                   Our method relies mainly on a linear transformation that is
                   efficiently learnable using pretrained word vectors and
                   linear regression. This transform is applicable on the fly in
                   the future when a new text feature or rare word is
                   encountered, even if only a single usage example is

                   performances of 5 different cross-language models on them.

                   that the use of human references as ground truth for

                   Emotion Shared Task (IEST) because the systems have to infer
                   the emotion mostly from the context. Every tweet has an
                   occurrence of an explicit emotion word that is masked. The
                   tweets are collected in a manner such that they are likely to
                   include a description of the cause of the emotion - the

                   a wide range of Natural Language Processing (NLP)
                   applications. However, embeddings trained on human-generated
                   corpora have been demonstrated to inherit strong gender
                   stereotypes that reflect social constructs. To address this
                   concern, in this paper, we propose a novel training procedure
                   for learning gender-neutral word embeddings. Our approach
                   aims to preserve gender information in certain dimensions of
                   word vectors while compelling other dimensions to be free of
                   gender influence. Based on the proposed method, we generate a
                   Gender-Neutral variant of GloVe (GN-GloVe). Quantitative and
                   qualitative experiments demonstrate that GN-GloVe
                   successfully isolates gender information without sacrificing
                   the functionality of the embedding model.",

               framework that we call model cards, to encourage such transparent
               model reporting. Model cards are short documents accompanying
               trained machine learning models that provide benchmarked
               evaluation in a variety of conditions, such as across different
               cultural, demographic, or phenotypic groups (e.g., race,
               geographic location, sex, Fitzpatrick skin type [15]) and
               intersectional groups (e.g., age and race, or sex and Fitzpatrick
               skin type) that are relevant to the intended application domains.
               Model cards also disclose the context in which models are
               intended to be used, details of the performance evaluation
               procedures, and other relevant information. While we focus
               primarily on human-centered machine learning models in the
               application fields of computer vision and natural language
               processing, this framework can be used to document any trained
               machine learning model. To solidify the concept, we provide cards
               for two supervised models: One trained to detect smiling faces in

                   pervasive and consistent across different word embedding

                   While the bias is indeed substantially reduced according to

                   can be recovered from them. We present a series of
                   experiments to support this claim, for two debiasing methods.

                   words with the same POS are syntactically valid in the same

                   word similarity benchmarks, and correlate the result with the
                   performance of word embedding models on these benchmarks. Our

                   regression tasks like semantic textual similarity (STS).
                   However, it requires that both sentences are fed into the

                   Finding the most similar pair in a collection of 10,000
                   sentences requires about 50 million inference computations

                   unsuitable for semantic similarity search as well as for

                   of gender bias as a projection over a linear subspace. An
                   alternative approach is Counterfactual Data Augmentation
                   (CDA), in which a corpus is duplicated and augmented to
                   remove bias, e.g. by swapping all inherently-gendered words
                   in the copy. We perform an empirical comparison of these
                   approaches on the English Gigaword and Wikipedia, and find
                   that whilst both successfully reduce direct bias and perform
                   well in tasks which quantify embedding quality, CDA variants
                   outperform projection-based methods at the task of drawing
                   non-biased gender analogies by an average of 19\% across both
                   corpora. We propose two improvements to CDA: Counterfactual
                   Data Substitution (CDS), a variant of CDA in which
                   potentially biased text is randomly substituted to avoid

                   following debiasing, previously biased words are
                   significantly less clustered according to gender (cluster
                   purity is reduced by 49\%), thus improving on the

                   bias definitions, (2) are tailored for a particular bias
                   (e.g., gender bias) and (3) have been evaluated
                   inconsistently and non-rigorously. In this work, we introduce
                   a general framework for debiasing word embeddings. We
                   operationalize the definition of a bias by discerning two
                   types of bias specification: explicit and implicit. We then
                   propose three debiasing models that operate on explicit or

                   data reflect the public discourse at the time the data was

                   independent of the identity of such entities mentioned in

  abstract      = "Warning: this paper contains content that may be offensive or
                   upsetting. Language has the power to reinforce stereotypes
                   and project social biases onto others. At the core of the
                   challenge is that it is rarely what is stated explicitly, but
                   rather the implied meanings, that frame people's judgments
                   about others. For example, given a statement that ``we
                   shouldn't lower our standards to hire more women,'' most
                   listeners will infer the implicature intended by the speaker
                   -- that ``women (candidates) are less qualified.'' Most
                   semantic formalisms, to date, do not capture such pragmatic
                   implications in which people express social biases and power
                   differentials in language. We introduce Social Bias Frames, a
                   new conceptual formalism that aims to model the pragmatic
                   frames in which people project social biases and stereotypes
                   onto others. In addition, we introduce the Social Bias
                   Inference Corpus to support large-scale modelling and
                   evaluation with 150k structured annotations of social media
                   posts, covering over 34k implications about a thousand
                   demographic groups. We then establish baseline approaches
                   that learn to recover Social Bias Frames from unstructured
                   text. We find that while state-of-the-art neural models are
                   effective at high-level categorization of whether a given
                   statement projects unwanted social bias (80\% F1), they are
                   not effective at spelling out more detailed explanations in
                   terms of Social Bias Frames. Our study motivates future work
                   that combines structured pragmatic inference with commonsense
                   reasoning on social implications.",

                   for objectivity. Yet bias in the form of inappropriate
                   subjectivity - introducing attitudes via framing,
                   presupposing truth, and casting doubt - remains ubiquitous.
                   This kind of bias erodes our collective trust and fuels
                   social conflict. To address this issue, we introduce a novel
                   testbed for natural language generation: automatically
                   bringing inappropriately subjective text into a neutral point
                   of view (``neutralizing'' biased text). We also offer the
                   first parallel corpus of biased language. The corpus contains
                   180,000 sentence pairs and originates from Wikipedia edits
                   that removed various framings, presuppositions, and attitudes
                   from biased sentences. Last, we propose two strong
                   encoder-decoder baselines for the task. A straightforward yet
                   opaque CONCURRENT system uses a BERT encoder to identify
                   subjective words as part of the generation process. An
                   interpretable and controllable MODULAR algorithm separates
                   these steps, using (1) a BERT-based classifier to identify
                   problematic words and (2) a novel join embedding through
                   which the classifier can edit the hidden states of the
                   encoder. Large-scale human evaluation across four domains
                   (encyclopedias, news headlines, books, and political
                   speeches) suggests that these algorithms are a first step

  abstract      = "To measure how well pretrained representations encode some
                   linguistic property, it is common to use accuracy of a probe,
                   i.e. a classifier trained to predict the property from the
                   representations. Despite widespread adoption of probes,
                   differences in their accuracy fail to adequately reflect
                   differences in representations. For example, they do not
                   substantially favour pretrained representations over randomly
                   initialized ones. Analogously, their accuracy can be similar
                   when probing for genuine linguistic labels and probing for
                   random synthetic tasks. To see reasonable differences in
                   accuracy with respect to these random baselines, previous
                   work had to constrain either the amount of probe training
                   data or its model size. Instead, we propose an alternative to
                   the standard probes, information-theoretic probing with
                   minimum description length (MDL). With MDL probing, training
                   a probe to predict labels is recast as teaching it to
                   effectively transmit the data. Therefore, the measure of
                   interest changes from probe accuracy to the description
                   length of labels given representations. In addition to probe
                   quality, the description length evaluates ``the amount of
                   effort'' needed to achieve the quality. This amount of effort
                   characterizes either (i) size of a probing model, or (ii) the
                   amount of data needed to achieve the high quality. We
                   consider two methods for estimating MDL which can be easily
                   implemented on top of the standard probing pipelines:
                   variational coding and online coding. We show that these
                   methods agree in results and are more informative and stable

                   power (the probability that, given a real effect, an

                   ignored by the NLP community. Underpowered experiments make
                   it more difficult to discern the difference between
                   statistical noise and meaningful model improvements, and
                   increase the chances of exaggerated findings. By
                   meta-analyzing a set of existing NLP papers and datasets, we
                   characterize typical power for a variety of settings and
                   conclude that underpowered experiments are common in the NLP
                   literature. In particular, for several tasks in the popular
                   GLUE benchmark, small test sets mean that most attempted

              needs of BLV researchers when reading papers, and to assess
              whether the SciA11y system could address these needs. We summarize
              our user study findings into a set of five design recommendations
              for accessible scientific reader systems. User response to SciA11y
              was positive, with all users saying they would be likely to use
              the system in the future, and some stating that the system, if
              available, would become their primary workflow. We successfully
              produce HTML renders for over 12M papers, of which an open access

                   that have been used widely but documented sparsely. This
                   paper aims to help address documentation debt for BookCorpus,
                   a popular text dataset for training large language models.
                   Notably, researchers have used BookCorpus to train OpenAI's
                   GPT-N models and Google's BERT models, even though little to
                   no documentation exists about the dataset's motivation,
                   composition, collection process, etc. We offer a preliminary
                   datasheet that provides key context and information about
                   BookCorpus, highlighting several notable deficiencies. In
                   particular, we find evidence that (1) BookCorpus likely
                   violates copyright restrictions for many books, (2)
                   BookCorpus contains thousands of duplicated books, and (3)
                   BookCorpus exhibits significant skews in genre

                   deficiencies that call for future research, including
                   problematic content, potential skews in religious

                   such as hyperparameters, training objectives, and natural
                   language templates (``prompts''). Here, we evaluate the
                   few-shot ability of LMs when such held-out examples are
                   unavailable, a setting we call true few-shot learning. We
                   test two model selection criteria, cross-validation and
                   minimum description length, for choosing LM prompts and

                   Contemporary neural topic models surpass classical ones

              estimation of causal peer effects are challenging in observational
              studies for two reasons. The first is the identification challenge
              due to unmeasured network confounding, for example, homophily bias
              and contextual confounding. The second issue is network dependence
              of observations, which one must take into account for valid
              statistical inference. Negative control variables, also known as
              placebo variables, have been widely used in observational studies
              including peer effect analysis over networks, although they have
              been used primarily for bias detection. In this article, we
              establish a formal framework which leverages a pair of negative
              control outcome and exposure variables (double negative controls)
              to nonparametrically identify causal peer effects in the presence
              of unmeasured network confounding. We then propose a generalized
              method of moments estimator for causal peer effects, and establish
              its consistency and asymptotic normality under an assumption about
              $\psi$-network dependence. Finally, we provide a network

                   methods for classification models, such as adversarial

                   optimise. In this paper, we propose a method for mitigating
                   bias in classifier training by incorporating contrastive
                   learning, in which instances sharing the same class label are
                   encouraged to have similar representations, while instances
                   sharing a protected attribute are forced further apart. In
                   such a way our method learns representations which capture
                   the task label in focused regions, while ensuring the
                   protected attribute has diverse spread, and thus has limited
                   impact on prediction and thereby results in fairer models.
                   Extensive experimental results across four tasks in NLP and

                   the essence of meaning has become generally accepted as being
                   well captured by the three orthogonal dimensions of
                   evaluation, potency, and activation (EPA). By re-examining
                   first types and then tokens for the English language, and
                   through the use of automatically annotated histograms --
                   `ousiograms' -- we find here that: 1. The essence of meaning
                   conveyed by words is instead best described by a compass-like
                   power-danger (PD) framework, and 2. Analysis of a disparate
                   collection of large-scale English language corpora --
                   literature, news, Wikipedia, talk radio, and social media --
                   shows that natural language exhibits a systematic bias toward
                   safe, low danger words -- a reinterpretation of the Pollyanna
                   principle's positivity bias for written expression. To help
                   justify our choice of dimension names and to help address the
                   problems with representing observed ousiometric dimensions by
                   bipolar adjective pairs, we introduce and explore
                   `synousionyms' and `antousionyms' -- ousiometric counterparts
                   of synonyms and antonyms. We further show that the PD
                   framework revises the circumplex model of affect as a more
                   general model of state of mind. Finally, we use our findings
                   to construct and test a prototype `ousiometer', a telegnomic
                   instrument that measures ousiometric time series for temporal
                   corpora. We contend that our power-danger ousiometric
                   framework provides a complement for entropy-based
                   measurements, and may be of value for the study of a wide
                   variety of communication across biological and artificial
                   life.",

                   established as text preprocessing for all kinds of NLP tasks
                   and improved the performances significantly. Unfortunately,
                   it has also been shown that these embeddings inherit various
                   kinds of biases from the training data and thereby pass on
                   biases present in society to NLP solutions. Many papers
                   attempted to quantify bias in word or sentence embeddings to
                   evaluate debiasing methods or compare different embedding
                   models, usually with cosine-based metrics. However, lately
                   some works have raised doubts about these metrics showing
                   that even though such metrics report low biases, other tests
                   still show biases. In fact, there is a great variety of bias
                   metrics or tests proposed in the literature without any
                   consensus on the optimal solutions. Yet we lack works that
                   evaluate bias metrics on a theoretical level or elaborate the
                   advantages and disadvantages of different bias metrics. In
                   this work, we will explore different cosine based bias
                   metrics. We formalize a bias definition based on the ideas
                   from previous works and derive conditions for bias metrics.
                   Furthermore, we thoroughly investigate the existing
                   cosine-based metrics and their limitations to show why these
                   metrics can fail to report biases in some cases. Finally, we
                   propose a new metric, SAME, to address the shortcomings of
                   existing metrics and mathematically prove that SAME behaves

                   understanding of the potential risks posed by these models is
                   needed. A wide range of established and anticipated risks are

                   and literature from computer science, linguistics, and social

                   toxic language, and lower performance by social group for

                   addresses risks arising from poor, false or misleading
                   information including in sensitive domains, and knock-on
                   risks such as the erosion of trust in shared information. The
                   fourth considers risks from actors who try to use LMs to
                   cause harm. The fifth focuses on risks specific to LLMs used

                   automation, and other challenges that may have a disparate

                   important problem. We formulate the problem of identifying

                   across diverse data distributions is critically important for
                   reliable applications. Motivated by this, there is a growing
                   focus on curating benchmark datasets that capture
                   distribution shifts. While valuable, the existing benchmarks
                   are limited in that many of them only contain a small number
                   of shifts and they lack systematic annotation about what is
                   different across different shifts. We present MetaShift--a
                   collection of 12,868 sets of natural images across 410
                   classes--to address this challenge. We leverage the natural
                   heterogeneity of Visual Genome and its annotations to
                   construct MetaShift. The key construction idea is to cluster
                   images using its metadata, which provides context for each
                   image (e.g. ``cats with cars'' or ``cats in bathroom'') that
                   represent distinct data distributions. MetaShift has two
                   important benefits: first, it contains orders of magnitude
                   more natural data shifts than previously available. Second,
                   it provides explicit explanations of what is unique about
                   each of its data sets and a distance score that measures the
                   amount of distribution shift between any two of its data
                   sets. We demonstrate the utility of MetaShift in benchmarking
                   several recent proposals for training models to be robust to
                   data shifts. We find that the simple empirical risk
                   minimization performs the best when shifts are moderate and
                   no method had a systematic advantage for large shifts. We
                   also show how MetaShift can help to visualize conflicts

                   removaL; SAL) to remove guarded information from neural
                   representations. Our method uses singular value decomposition
                   and eigenvalue decomposition to project the input
                   representations into directions with reduced covariance with
                   the guarded information rather than maximal covariance as
                   normally these factorization methods are used. We begin with
                   linear information removal and proceed to generalize our
                   algorithm to the case of nonlinear information removal
                   through the use of kernels. Our experiments demonstrate that
                   our algorithm retains better main task performance after
                   removing the guarded information compared to previous
                   methods. In addition, our experiments demonstrate that we
                   need a relatively small amount of guarded attribute data to
                   remove information about these attributes, which lowers the
                   exposure to such possibly sensitive data and fits better

  abstract      = "English pretrained language models, which make up the
                   backbone of many modern NLP systems, require huge amounts of
                   unlabeled training data. These models are generally presented
                   as being trained only on English text but have been found to
                   transfer surprisingly well to other languages. We investigate
                   this phenomenon and find that common English pretraining
                   corpora actually contain significant amounts of non-English
                   text: even when less than 1\% of data is not English (well
                   within the error rate of strong language classifiers), this
                   leads to hundreds of millions of foreign language tokens in
                   large-scale datasets. We then demonstrate that even these
                   small percentages of non-English data facilitate
                   cross-lingual transfer for models trained on them, with
                   target language performance strongly correlated to the amount
                   of in-language data seen during pretraining. In light of
                   these findings, we argue that no model is truly monolingual
                   when pretrained at scale, which should be considered when

                   through more deliberate reflection on datasets and
                   transparency around the processes by which they are created,
                   researchers and practitioners have begun to advocate for
                   increased data documentation and have proposed several data
                   documentation frameworks. However, there is little research
                   on whether these data documentation frameworks meet the needs
                   of ML practitioners, who both create and consume datasets. To
                   address this gap, we set out to understand ML practitioners'
                   data documentation perceptions, needs, challenges, and
                   desiderata, with the goal of deriving design requirements
                   that can inform future data documentation frameworks. We
                   conducted a series of semi-structured interviews with 14 ML
                   practitioners at a single large, international technology
                   company. We had them answer a list of questions taken from
                   datasheets for datasets (Gebru, 2021). Our findings show that
                   current approaches to data documentation are largely ad hoc
                   and myopic in nature. Participants expressed needs for data
                   documentation frameworks to be adaptable to their contexts,
                   integrated into their existing tools and workflows, and
                   automated wherever possible. Despite the fact that data
                   documentation frameworks are often motivated from the
                   perspective of responsible AI, participants did not make the
                   connection between the questions that they were asked to
                   answer and their responsible AI implications. In addition,
                   participants often had difficulties prioritizing the needs of
                   dataset consumers and providing information that someone
                   unfamiliar with their datasets might need to know. Based on

              the existing preference models that KG-based systems maintain for
              recommending content. The vast scale and open-ended nature of
              knowledge graphs (KGs) make exploratory search over them
              cognitively demanding for users. We introduce a new technique,
              polymorphic lenses , that im-proves exploratory search over a KG
              by obtaining new leverage from the existing preference models that
              KG-based systems maintain for recommending content. The approach
              is based on a simple but powerful observation: in a KG, preference
              models can be re-targeted to recommend not only entities of a
              single base entity type (e.g., papers in the scientific literature
              KG, products in an e-commerce KG), but also all other types (e.g.,
              authors, conferences, institutions; sellers, buyers). We implement
              our technique in a novel system, FeedLens, which is built over
              Semantic Scholar, a production system for navigating the
              scientific literature KG. FeedLens reuses the existing preference
              models on Semantic Scholar-- people's curated research feeds--as
              lenses for exploratory search. Semantic Scholar users can curate
              multiple feeds/lenses for different topics of interest, e.g., one
              for human-centered AI and another for document embeddings.
              Although these lenses are defined in terms of papers, FeedLens
              re-purposes them to also guide search over authors, institutions,
              venues, etc. Our system design is based on feedback from intended
              users via two pilot surveys ( 𝑛 = 17 and 𝑛 = 13, respectively).
              We compare FeedLens and Semantic Scholar via a third
              (within-subjects) user study ( 𝑛 = 15) and find that FeedLens
              increases user engagement while reducing the cognitive effort
              required to complete a short literature review task. Our
              qualitative results also highlight people's preference for this
              more effective exploratory search experience enabled by FeedLens.",

                   conferences, it is important to understand how effective they
                   are at diffusing ideas. Most previous attempts to analyze
                   this question have struggled to separate causation from
                   correlation and used potentially biased measures like
                   self-reported learning. Here, we propose a novel approach
                   using scheduling conflicts. When multiple presentations of
                   interest to an attendee are scheduled at the same time, the
                   attendee is less able to see them, on average. If seeing
                   presentations influences future research, then conflicting
                   presentations should influence research less than
                   unconflicting ones. Analyzing conflicts in the personalized
                   schedules of 1960 attendees of 20 computer science
                   conferences reveals that when an attendee is able to see a
                   paper presentation, she is almost twice as likely to cite the
                   paper in her future work. The effect is robust to underlying
                   differences between attendees, papers, and paper authors, and
                   is even larger for a stronger measure of influence -- citing

  abstract      = "Modern machine learning research relies on relatively few
                   carefully curated datasets. Even in these datasets, and
                   typically in `untidy' or raw data, practitioners are faced
                   with significant issues of data quality and diversity which
                   can be prohibitively labor intensive to address. Existing
                   methods for dealing with these challenges tend to make strong
                   assumptions about the particular issues at play, and often
                   require a priori knowledge or metadata such as domain labels.
                   Our work is orthogonal to these methods: we instead focus on
                   providing a unified and efficient framework for Metadata
                   Archaeology -- uncovering and inferring metadata of examples
                   in a dataset. We curate different subsets of data that might
                   exist in a dataset (e.g. mislabeled, atypical, or
                   out-of-distribution examples) using simple transformations,
                   and leverage differences in learning dynamics between these
                   probe suites to infer metadata of interest. Our method is on
                   par with far more sophisticated mitigation methods across
                   different tasks: identifying and correcting mislabeled
                   examples, classifying minority-group samples, prioritizing

                   summarization, focusing on the classic benchmark domain of
                   news summarization. First, we investigate how zero-shot GPT-3
                   compares against fine-tuned models trained on large
                   summarization datasets. We show that not only do humans
                   overwhelmingly prefer GPT-3 summaries, but these also do not
                   suffer from common dataset-specific issues such as poor
                   factuality. Next, we study what this means for evaluation,
                   particularly the role of gold standard test sets. Our
                   experiments show that both reference-based and reference-free
                   automatic metrics, e.g. recently proposed QA- or
                   entailment-based factuality approaches, cannot reliably

                   success of this approach, it remains unclear to what extent
                   these gains are attributable to the massive background
                   corpora employed for pretraining versus to the pretraining
                   objectives themselves. This paper introduces a large-scale
                   study of self-pretraining, where the same (downstream)
                   training data is used for both pretraining and finetuning. In
                   experiments addressing both ELECTRA and RoBERTa models and 10
                   distinct downstream datasets, we observe that
                   self-pretraining rivals standard pretraining on the BookWiki
                   corpus (despite using around $10\times$--$500\times$ less

                   performance gains attributable to pretraining are driven
                   primarily by the pretraining objective itself and are not
                   always attributable to the incorporation of massive datasets.

               generalisation studies, and we make recommendations for which

               based on an extensive literature review of generalisation
               research, and contains five axes along which studies can differ:
               their main motivation, the type of generalisation they aim to

               this data shift is obtained, and the locus of the shift within

                   previous work has mostly addressed it in the context of
                   structured, well-defined segments, such as segmentation into
                   paragraphs, chapters, or segmenting text that originated from
                   multiple sources. We tackle the task of segmenting running
                   (spoken) narratives, which poses hitherto unaddressed
                   challenges. As a test case, we address Holocaust survivor
                   testimonies, given in English. Other than the importance of
                   studying these testimonies for Holocaust research, we argue
                   that they provide an interesting test case for topical
                   segmentation, due to their unstructured surface level,
                   relative abundance (tens of thousands of such testimonies
                   were collected), and the relatively confined domain that they
                   cover. We hypothesize that boundary points between segments
                   correspond to low mutual information between the sentences
                   proceeding and following the boundary. Based on this
                   hypothesis, we explore a range of algorithmic approaches to
                   the task, building on previous work on segmentation that uses
                   generative Bayesian modeling and state-of-the-art neural
                   machinery. Compared to manually annotated references, we find

                   However, it is common knowledge among researchers that a vast
                   number of papers accepted at top NLP venues come from a
                   handful of western countries and (lately) China; whereas,
                   very few papers from Africa and South America get published.
                   Similar disparities are also believed to exist for paper
                   citation counts. In the spirit of ``what we do not measure,
                   we cannot improve'', this work asks a series of questions on
                   the relationship between geographical location and
                   publication success (acceptance in top NLP venues and
                   citation impact). We first created a dataset of 70,000 papers
                   from the ACL Anthology, extracted their meta-information, and
                   generated their citation network. We then show that not only
                   are there substantial geographical disparities in paper
                   acceptance and citation but also that these disparities
                   persist even when controlling for a number of variables such
                   as venue of publication and sub-field of NLP. Further,
                   despite some steps taken by the NLP community to improve
                   geographical diversity, we show that the disparity in
                   publication metrics across locations is still on an
                   increasing trend since the early 2000s. We release our code

                   remove entity errors if a suitable input entity replacement

                   recent years is that this technology has displayed harmful
                   biases, from generating derogatory stereotypes to producing
                   disparate outcomes for different social groups. Although a
                   lot of effort has been invested in assessing and mitigating
                   these biases, our methods of measuring the biases of NLP
                   models have serious problems and it is often unclear what
                   they actually measure. In this paper, we provide an
                   interdisciplinary approach to discussing the issue of NLP
                   model bias by adopting the lens of psychometrics -- a field
                   specialized in the measurement of concepts like bias that are
                   not directly observable. In particular, we will explore two
                   central notions from psychometrics, the \emph{construct
                   validity} and the \emph{reliability} of measurement tools,
                   and discuss how they can be applied in the context of
                   measuring model bias. Our goal is to provide NLP
                   practitioners with methodological tools for designing better
                   bias measures, and to inspire them more generally to explore
                   tools from psychometrics when working on bias measurement

                   BERT-based word sense induction to find additional words that
                   are widespread but overloaded with different uses across
                   fields. We define scholarly jargon as discipline-specific

                   highlighting two key social implications. First, we measure

                   Demonstrate-Search-Predict (DSP), a framework that relies on
                   passing natural language texts in sophisticated pipelines
                   between an LM and an RM. DSP can express high-level programs
                   that bootstrap pipeline-aware demonstrations, search for

                   systematically breaking down problems into small

              Stylometry is mostly applied to authorial style. More recently,
              researchers have begun investigating the style of characters ,
              finding that, although there is detectable stylistic variation,
              the variation remains within authorial bounds. In this article, we
              address the stylistic distinctiveness of characters in drama. Our

                   that are used differently by two or more communities. But
                   word embeddings are complex, high-dimensional spaces and a

                   embeddings to map out how words are used differently.
                   Specifically, we describe the construction of dialectograms,
                   an unsupervised way to visually explore the characteristic

                   often not black-and-white and expressions of uncertainty

                   comprehensive evaluation of GPT-4, a state-of-the-art LLM, on
                   medical competency examinations and benchmark datasets. GPT-4
                   is a general-purpose model that is not specialized for
                   medical problems through training or engineered to solve
                   clinical tasks. Our analysis covers two sets of official
                   practice materials for the USMLE, a three-step examination
                   program used to assess clinical competency and grant
                   licensure in the United States. We also evaluate performance
                   on the MultiMedQA suite of benchmark datasets. Beyond
                   measuring model performance, experiments were conducted to
                   investigate the influence of test questions containing both
                   text and images on model performance, probe for memorization
                   of content during training, and study probability
                   calibration, which is of critical importance in high-stakes
                   applications like medicine. Our results show that GPT-4,
                   without any specialized prompt crafting, exceeds the passing
                   score on USMLE by over 20 points and outperforms earlier
                   general-purpose models (GPT-3.5) as well as models
                   specifically fine-tuned on medical knowledge (Med-PaLM, a
                   prompt-tuned version of Flan-PaLM 540B). In addition, GPT-4
                   is significantly better calibrated than GPT-3.5,
                   demonstrating a much-improved ability to predict the
                   likelihood that its answers are correct. We also explore the
                   behavior of the model qualitatively through a case study that

                   expressions governed by grammatical rules. It poses a
                   significant challenge to develop capable AI algorithms for
                   comprehending and grasping a language. As a major approach,
                   language modeling has been widely studied for language
                   understanding and generation in the past two decades,
                   evolving from statistical language models to neural language
                   models. Recently, pre-trained language models (PLMs) have
                   been proposed by pre-training Transformer models over
                   large-scale corpora, showing strong capabilities in solving
                   various NLP tasks. Since researchers have found that model
                   scaling can lead to performance improvement, they further
                   study the scaling effect by increasing the model size to an
                   even larger size. Interestingly, when the parameter scale
                   exceeds a certain level, these enlarged language models not
                   only achieve a significant performance improvement but also
                   show some special abilities that are not present in
                   small-scale language models. To discriminate the difference
                   in parameter scale, the research community has coined the
                   term large language models (LLM) for the PLMs of significant
                   size. Recently, the research on LLMs has been largely
                   advanced by both academia and industry, and a remarkable
                   progress is the launch of ChatGPT, which has attracted
                   widespread attention from society. The technical evolution of
                   LLMs has been making an important impact on the entire AI
                   community, which would revolutionize the way how we develop
                   and use AI algorithms. In this survey, we review the recent
                   advances of LLMs by introducing the background, key findings,
                   and mainstream techniques. In particular, we focus on four
                   major aspects of LLMs, namely pre-training, adaptation
                   tuning, utilization, and capacity evaluation. Besides, we

                   In this paper, we introduce generative agents--computational
                   software agents that simulate believable human behavior.
                   Generative agents wake up, cook breakfast, and head to work;
                   artists paint, while authors write; they form opinions,
                   notice each other, and initiate conversations; they remember
                   and reflect on days past as they plan the next day. To enable
                   generative agents, we describe an architecture that extends a
                   large language model to store a complete record of the
                   agent's experiences using natural language, synthesize those
                   memories over time into higher-level reflections, and
                   retrieve them dynamically to plan behavior. We instantiate
                   generative agents to populate an interactive sandbox
                   environment inspired by The Sims, where end users can
                   interact with a small town of twenty five agents using
                   natural language. In an evaluation, these generative agents
                   produce believable individual and emergent social behaviors:
                   for example, starting with only a single user-specified
                   notion that one agent wants to throw a Valentine's Day party,
                   the agents autonomously spread invitations to the party over
                   the next two days, make new acquaintances, ask each other out
                   on dates to the party, and coordinate to show up for the
                   party together at the right time. We demonstrate through
                   ablation that the components of our agent
                   architecture--observation, planning, and reflection--each
                   contribute critically to the believability of agent behavior.
                   By fusing large language models with computational,
                   interactive agents, this work introduces architectural and
                   interaction patterns for enabling believable simulations of
                   human behavior.",

  abstract = "Proximal causal inference is a recently proposed framework for
              evaluating the causal effect of a treatment on an outcome variable
              in the presence of unmeasured confounding (Miao et al., 2018a;
              Tchetgen Tchetgen et al., 2020). For nonparametric point
              identification, the framework leverages proxy variables of
              unobserved confounders, provided that such proxies are
              sufficiently relevant for the latter, a requirement that has
              previously been formalized as a completeness condition.
              Completeness is key to connecting the observed proxy data to
              hidden factors via a so-called confounding bridge function,
              identification of which is an important step towards proxy-based
              point identification of causal effects. However, completeness is
              well-known not to be empirically testable, therefore potentially
              restricting the application of the proximal causal framework. In
              this paper, we propose partial identification methods that do not
              require completeness and obviate the need for identification of a
              bridge function. That is, we establish that proxies of unobserved
              confounders can be leveraged to obtain bounds on the causal effect
              of the treatment on the outcome even if available information does
              not suffice to identify either a bridge function or a
              corresponding causal effect of interest. We further establish
              analogous partial identification results in related settings where
              identification hinges upon hidden mediators for which proxies are
              available, however such proxies are not sufficiently rich for
              point identification of a bridge function or a corresponding
              causal effect of interest.",

                   most appropriate trust definition to depict user trust in a
                   specific context should be the focus instead of comparing
                   definitions. User trust in AI-enabled systems is found to be
                   influenced by three main themes, namely socio-ethical
                   considerations, technical and design features, and user
                   characteristics. User characteristics dominate the findings,
                   reinforcing the importance of user involvement from
                   development through to monitoring of AI enabled systems. In
                   conclusion, user trust needs to be addressed directly in
                   every context where AI-enabled systems are being used or
                   discussed. In addition, calibrating the user-AI relationship
                   requires finding the optimal balance that works for not only
                   the user but also the system.",

                   This work provides a road map for using LLMs as CSS tools.
                   Towards this end, we contribute a set of prompting best
                   practices and an extensive evaluation pipeline to measure the
                   zero-shot performance of 13 language models on 24
                   representative CSS benchmarks. On taxonomic labeling tasks

                   However, we find that CoT explanations can systematically

                   demonstrate that CoT explanations can be heavily influenced

                   reordering the multiple-choice options in a few-shot prompt
                   to make the answer always ``(A)'' -- which models

                   practices often conflate different possible sources of model

                   principled comparisons between different models under
                   comparable conditions. These practices (i) leave us

                   should be used under what circumstances; (ii) impede

                   challenging. Existing question answering datasets for

                   complexity of information needs and documentation burdens
                   experienced by clinicians. To address these challenges, we
                   introduce MedAlign, a benchmark dataset of 983 natural
                   language instructions for EHR data. MedAlign is curated by 15
                   clinicians (7 specialities), includes clinician-written
                   reference responses for 303 instructions, and provides 276
                   longitudinal EHRs for grounding instruction-response pairs.
                   We used MedAlign to evaluate 6 general domain LLMs, having

                   accuracy moving from 32k to 2k context lengths for GPT-4.

                   lightweight manner that can be done on a single GPU.
                   Specifically, we focus on the OPT family of models ranging
                   from 125m to 66b parameters and rely only on whether an FFN
                   neuron is activated or not. First, we find that the early
                   part of the network is sparse and represents many discrete
                   features. Here, many neurons (more than 70\% in some layers
                   of the 66b model) are ``dead'', i.e. they never activate on a
                   large collection of diverse data. At the same time, many of
                   the alive neurons are reserved for discrete features and act
                   as token and n-gram detectors. Interestingly, their
                   corresponding FFN updates not only promote next token
                   candidates as could be expected, but also explicitly focus on
                   removing the information about triggering them tokens, i.e.,
                   current input. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
                   first example of mechanisms specialized at removing (rather
                   than adding) information from the residual stream. With
                   scale, models become more sparse in a sense that they have
                   more dead neurons and token detectors. Finally, some neurons
                   are positional: them being activated or not depends largely
                   (or solely) on position and less so (or not at all) on
                   textual data. We find that smaller models have sets of
                   neurons acting as position range indicators while larger

                   individual compositions of their gender, age, educational
                   background, etc.) have a strong impact on their decisions
                   when working on subjective NLP tasks, such as hate speech
                   detection. Often, heterogeneous backgrounds result in high
                   disagreements. To model this variation, recent work has
                   explored sociodemographic prompting, a technique, which
                   steers the output of prompt-based models towards answers that
                   humans with specific sociodemographic profiles would give.
                   However, the available NLP literature disagrees on the
                   efficacy of this technique -- it remains unclear, for which
                   tasks and scenarios it can help and evaluations are limited
                   to specific tasks only. We address this research gap by
                   presenting the largest and most comprehensive study of
                   sociodemographic prompting today. Concretely, we evaluate
                   several prompt formulations across seven datasets and six
                   instruction-tuned model families. We find that (1) while
                   sociodemographic prompting can be beneficial for improving
                   zero-shot learning in subjective NLP tasks, (2) its outcomes
                   largely vary for different model types, sizes, and datasets,
                   (3) are subject to large variance with regards to prompt
                   formulations. Thus, sociodemographic prompting is not a
                   reliable proxy for traditional data annotation with a
                   sociodemographically heterogeneous group of annotators.
                   Instead, we propose (4) to use it for identifying ambiguous
                   instances resulting in more informed annotation efforts.",

                   be accessible by observing the trajectory of the training
                   process. In this paper, we present a case study of syntax
                   acquisition in masked language models (MLMs). Our findings
                   demonstrate how analyzing the evolution of interpretable
                   artifacts throughout training deepens our understanding of
                   emergent behavior. In particular, we study Syntactic
                   Attention Structure (SAS), a naturally emerging property of
                   MLMs wherein specific Transformer heads tend to focus on
                   specific syntactic relations. We identify a brief window in
                   training when models abruptly acquire SAS and find that this

                   precipitates the subsequent acquisition of linguistic

                   introducing a regularizer to manipulate SAS during training,
                   and demonstrate that SAS is necessary for the development of
                   grammatical capabilities. We further find that SAS competes
                   with other beneficial traits and capabilities during
                   training, and that briefly suppressing SAS can improve model
                   quality. These findings reveal a real-world example of the

                   pipelines, can now be accomplished by an LLM-assisted scholar

               application to transcripts of interviews with Rohingya refugees

               introducing biases that can lead to misleading inferences. We
               here mean bias in the technical sense, that the errors that LLMs
               make in annotating interview transcripts are not random with
               respect to the characteristics of the interview subjects.
               Training simpler supervised models on high-quality human

  abstract      = "Despite the growing consensus that stakeholders affected by
                   AI systems should participate in their design, enormous
                   variation and implicit disagreements exist among current
                   approaches. For researchers and practitioners who are
                   interested in taking a participatory approach to AI design
                   and development, it remains challenging to assess the extent
                   to which any participatory approach grants substantive agency
                   to stakeholders. This article thus aims to ground what we dub
                   the ``participatory turn'' in AI design by synthesizing
                   existing theoretical literature on participation and through
                   empirical investigation and critique of its current
                   practices. Specifically, we derive a conceptual framework
                   through synthesis of literature across technology design,
                   political theory, and the social sciences that researchers
                   and practitioners can leverage to evaluate approaches to
                   participation in AI design. Additionally, we articulate
                   empirical findings concerning the current state of
                   participatory practice in AI design based on an analysis of
                   recently published research and semi-structured interviews
                   with 12 AI researchers and practitioners. We use these
                   empirical findings to understand the current state of
                   participatory practice and subsequently provide guidance to
                   better align participatory goals and methods in a way that
                   accounts for practical constraints.",

  abstract      = "Language models (LMs) can be directed to perform target tasks
                   by using labeled examples or natural language prompts. But
                   selecting examples or writing prompts for can be
                   challenging--especially in tasks that involve unusual edge
                   cases, demand precise articulation of nebulous preferences,
                   or require an accurate mental model of LM behavior. We
                   propose to use *LMs themselves* to guide the task
                   specification process. In this paper, we introduce
                   **Generative Active Task Elicitation (GATE)**: a learning
                   framework in which models elicit and infer intended behavior
                   through free-form, language-based interaction with users. We
                   study GATE in three domains: email validation, content
                   recommendation, and moral reasoning. In preregistered
                   experiments, we show that LMs prompted to perform GATE (e.g.,
                   by generating open-ended questions or synthesizing
                   informative edge cases) elicit responses that are often more
                   informative than user-written prompts or labels. Users report
                   that interactive task elicitation requires less effort than
                   prompting or example labeling and surfaces novel
                   considerations not initially anticipated by users. Our
                   findings suggest that LM-driven elicitation can be a powerful
                   tool for aligning models to complex human preferences and

                   pace, with myriad applications under development. Unlike most
                   earlier machine learning models, they are no longer built for
                   one specific application but are designed to excel in a wide
                   range of tasks. A major part of this success is due to their
                   huge training datasets and the unprecedented number of model
                   parameters, which allow them to memorize large amounts of
                   information contained in the training data. This memorization
                   goes beyond mere language, and encompasses information only
                   present in a few documents. This is often desirable since it
                   is necessary for performing tasks such as question answering,
                   and therefore an important part of learning, but also brings
                   a whole array of issues, from privacy and security to
                   copyright and beyond. LLMs can memorize short secrets in the
                   training data, but can also memorize concepts like facts or
                   writing styles that can be expressed in text in many
                   different ways. We propose a taxonomy for memorization in
                   LLMs that covers verbatim text, facts, ideas and algorithms,
                   writing styles, distributional properties, and alignment
                   goals. We describe the implications of each type of
                   memorization - both positive and negative - for model
                   performance, privacy, security and confidentiality,
                   copyright, and auditing, and ways to detect and prevent
                   memorization. We further highlight the challenges that arise
                   from the predominant way of defining memorization with
                   respect to model behavior instead of model weights, due to
                   LLM-specific phenomena such as reasoning capabilities or
                   differences between decoding algorithms. Throughout the
                   paper, we describe potential risks and opportunities arising
                   from memorization in LLMs that we hope will motivate new

                   accomplish grounding, humans rely on a range of dialogue

                   dialogue datasets, and comparing the results to humans. We
                   find that current LLMs are presumptive grounders, biased
                   towards assuming common ground without using grounding acts.
                   To understand the roots of this behavior, we examine the role
                   of instruction tuning and reinforcement learning with human
                   feedback (RLHF), finding that RLHF leads to less grounding.
                   Altogether, our work highlights the need for more research

                   systems to low-resource languages. However, concrete evidence
                   for the effects of multilinguality on language modeling
                   performance in individual languages remains scarce. Here, we
                   pre-train over 10,000 monolingual and multilingual language
                   models for over 250 languages, including multiple language
                   families that are under-studied in NLP. We assess how
                   language modeling performance in each language varies as a
                   function of (1) monolingual dataset size, (2) added
                   multilingual dataset size, (3) linguistic similarity of the
                   added languages, and (4) model size (up to 45M parameters).
                   We find that in moderation, adding multilingual data improves
                   low-resource language modeling performance, similar to
                   increasing low-resource dataset sizes by up to 33\%.
                   Improvements depend on the syntactic similarity of the added
                   multilingual data, with marginal additional effects of
                   vocabulary overlap. However, high-resource languages
                   consistently perform worse in multilingual pre-training
                   scenarios. As dataset sizes increase, adding multilingual
                   data begins to hurt performance for both low-resource and
                   high-resource languages, likely due to limited model capacity
                   (the ``curse of multilinguality''). These results suggest
                   that massively multilingual pre-training may not be optimal
                   for any languages involved, but that more targeted models can
                   significantly improve performance.",

                   operates on top of black-box LMs to achieve the result of
                   directly tuning the model, but by accessing only its
                   prediction over the output vocabulary. Our method instead
                   tunes a smaller LM, then applies the difference between the
                   predictions of the small tuned and untuned LMs to shift the
                   original predictions of the base model in the direction of
                   tuning, while retaining the benefits of larger scale

                   people were less influenced by knowing an idea was from AI,
                   and that participants were more likely to knowingly adopt AI

                   GPT-3.5 we generated and coded 9,606 discharge summaries
                   based on lists of ICD-10 code descriptions of patients with
                   infrequent (generation) codes within the MIMIC-IV dataset.
                   Combined with the baseline training set, this formed an
                   augmented training set. Neural coding models were trained on
                   baseline and augmented data and evaluated on a MIMIC-IV test
                   set. We report micro- and macro-F1 scores on the full
                   codeset, generation codes, and their families. Weak
                   Hierarchical Confusion Matrices were employed to determine
                   within-family and outside-of-family coding errors in the
                   latter codesets. The coding performance of GPT-3.5 was
                   evaluated both on prompt-guided self-generated data and real
                   MIMIC-IV data. Clinical professionals evaluated the clinical
                   acceptability of the generated documents. Results:
                   Augmentation slightly hinders the overall performance of the
                   models but improves performance for the generation candidate
                   codes and their families, including one unseen in the
                   baseline training data. Augmented models display lower
                   out-of-family error rates. GPT-3.5 can identify ICD-10 codes
                   by the prompted descriptions, but performs poorly on real
                   data. Evaluators note the correctness of generated concepts
                   while suffering in variety, supporting information, and
                   narrative. Discussion and Conclusion: GPT-3.5 alone is
                   unsuitable for ICD-10 coding. Augmentation positively affects
                   generation code families but mainly benefits codes with
                   existing examples. Augmentation reduces out-of-family errors.

                   models, practitioners and regulators alike have pointed to AI
                   red-teaming as a key component of their strategies for
                   identifying and mitigating these risks. However, despite AI
                   red-teaming's central role in policy discussions and

                   how precisely it relates to conventional red-teaming
                   practices as originally conceived in the field of
                   cybersecurity. In this work, we identify recent cases of
                   red-teaming activities in the AI industry and conduct an
                   extensive survey of the relevant research literature to
                   characterize the scope, structure, and criteria for AI

                   methods), and the resulting decisions it informs (e.g.,
                   reporting, disclosure, and mitigation). In light of our

                   big-tent idea for characterizing a broad set of activities
                   and attitudes aimed at improving the behavior of GenAI

                   LLM-generated summaries of fictional books. Our study

                   summaries of books published in 2023 or 2024, and we hire
                   annotators who have fully read each book prior to the
                   annotation task to minimize cost and cognitive burden. We
                   collect FABLES, a dataset of annotations on 3,158 claims made
                   in LLM-generated summaries of 26 books, at a cost of \$5.2K
                   USD, which allows us to rank LLM summarizers based on
                   faithfulness: Claude-3-Opus significantly outperforms all
                   closed-source LLMs, while the open-source Mixtral is on par
                   with GPT-3.5-Turbo. An analysis of the annotations reveals
                   that most unfaithful claims relate to events and character
                   states, and they generally require indirect reasoning over
                   the narrative to invalidate. While LLM-based auto-raters have
                   proven reliable for factuality and coherence in other
                   settings, we implement several LLM raters of faithfulness and
                   find that none correlates strongly with human annotations,
                   especially with regard to detecting unfaithful claims. Our
                   experiments suggest that detecting unfaithful claims is an
                   important future direction not only for summarization
                   evaluation but also as a testbed for long-context
                   understanding. Finally, we move beyond faithfulness by
                   exploring content selection errors in book-length
                   summarization: we develop a typology of omission errors
                   related to crucial narrative elements and also identify a

                   LLMs must navigate interactions, respect social norms, and

                   unclear if LLMs can adapt their outputs to diverse cultural
                   norms. Our study focuses on this aspect. We introduce NormAd,
                   a novel dataset, which includes 2.6k stories that represent
                   social and cultural norms from 75 countries, to assess the
                   ability of LLMs to adapt to different granular levels of
                   socio-cultural contexts such as the country of origin, its
                   associated cultural values, and prevalent social norms. Our
                   study reveals that LLMs struggle with cultural reasoning
                   across all contextual granularities, showing stronger
                   adaptability to English-centric cultures over those from the

                   cultures. Due to inherent agreement or sycophancy biases,

                   those that deviate from them. Our benchmark measures the

  abstract      = "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to
                   clinical decision-making. However, their potential to exhibit
                   bias poses significant risks to clinical equity. Currently,
                   there is a lack of benchmarks that systematically evaluate
                   such clinical bias in LLMs. While in downstream tasks, some
                   biases of LLMs can be avoided such as by instructing the
                   model to answer ``I'm not sure...'', the internal bias hidden
                   within the model still lacks deep studies. We introduce CLIMB
                   (shorthand for A Benchmark of Clinical Bias in Large Language
                   Models), a pioneering comprehensive benchmark to evaluate
                   both intrinsic (within LLMs) and extrinsic (on downstream
                   tasks) bias in LLMs for clinical decision tasks. Notably, for
                   intrinsic bias, we introduce a novel metric, AssocMAD, to
                   assess the disparities of LLMs across multiple demographic
                   groups. Additionally, we leverage counterfactual intervention
                   to evaluate extrinsic bias in a task of clinical diagnosis
                   prediction. Our experiments across popular and medically
                   adapted LLMs, particularly from the Mistral and LLaMA
                   families, unveil prevalent behaviors with both intrinsic and
                   extrinsic bias. This work underscores the critical need to
                   mitigate clinical bias and sets a new standard for future
                   evaluations of LLMs' clinical bias.",

              consumer-to-consumer communications-is an increasingly important
              technique. Reviewing and synthesizing extant WOM theory, this
              article shows how marketers employing social media marketing
              methods face a situation of networked coproduction of narratives.
              It then presents a study of a marketing campaign in which mobile
              phones were seeded with prominent bloggers. Eighty-three blogs
              were followed for six months. The findings indicate that this
              network of communications offers four social media communication
              strategies-evaluation, embracing, endorsement, and explanation.
              Each is influenced by character narrative, communications forum,
              communal norms, and the nature of the marketing promotion. This
              new narrative model shows that communal WOM does not simply
              increase or amplify marketing messages; rather, marketing messages
              and meanings are systematically altered in the process of
              embedding them. The theory has definite, pragmatic implications
              for how marketers should plan, target, and leverage WOM and how
              scholars should understand WOM in a networked world. (PsycINFO

              based on their theoretical and empirical comparisons between the
              naive Bayes classifier and linear logistic regression, Ng and
              Jordan (NIPS 841-848, 2001) claimed that there exist two distinct
              regimes of performance between the generative and discriminative
              classifiers with regard to the training-set size. In this paper,
              our empirical and simulation studies, as a complement of their
              work, however, suggest that the existence of the two distinct
              regimes may not be so reliable. In addition, for real world
              datasets, so far there is no theoretically correct, general
              criterion for choosing between the discriminative and the
              generative approaches to classification of an observation x into a
              class y; the choice depends on the relative confidence we have in
              the correctness of the specification of either p(y vertical bar x)
              or p(x, y) for the data. This can be to some extent a

              and O'Neill (J Am Stat Assoc 75(369):154-160, 1980) prefer
              normal-based linear discriminant analysis (LDA) when no model
              mis-specification occurs but other empirical studies may prefer
              linear logistic regression instead. Furthermore, we suggest that
              pairing of either LDA assuming a common diagonal covariance matrix
              (LDA-A) or the naive Bayes classifier and linear logistic
              regression may not be perfect, and hence it may not be reliable
              for any claim that was derived from the comparison between LDA-A
              or the naive Bayes classifier and linear logistic regression to be

              an issue of considerable interest. Recent work has developed
              methods for tracking topic shifts over long time scales, as well
              as abrupt spikes in the appearance of particular named entities.
              However, these approaches are less well suited to the
              identification of content that spreads widely and then fades over
              time scales on the order of days - the time scale at which we
              perceive news and events. We develop a framework for tracking
              short, distinctive phrases that travel relatively intact through
              on-line text; developing scalable algorithms for clustering
              textual variants of such phrases, we identify a broad class of
              memes that exhibit wide spread and rich variation on a daily
              basis. As our principal domain of study, we show how such a
              meme-tracking approach can provide a coherent representation of
              the news cycle - the daily rhythms in the news media that have
              long been the subject of qualitative interpretation but have never
              been captured accurately enough to permit actual quantitative
              analysis. We tracked 1.6 million mainstream media sites and blogs
              over a period of three months with the total of 90 million
              articles and we find a set of novel and persistent temporal
              patterns in the news cycle. In particular, we observe a typical
              lag of 2.5 hours between the peaks of attention to a phrase in the
              news media and in blogs respectively, with divergent behavior
              around the overall peak and a ``heartbeat''-like pattern in the
              handoff between news and blogs. We also develop and analyze a

              of named entity classification. A large number of rules is needed
              for coverage of the domain, suggesting that a fairly large number
              of la- beled examples should be required to train a classi- fier.
              However, we show that the use of unlabeled data can reduce the
              requirements for supervision to just 7 simple ``seed'' rules. The
              approach gains leverage from natural redundancy in the data: for
              many named-entity instances both the spelling of the name and the
              context inwhich it appears are sufficient to determine its type.
              We present two algorithms. The first method uses a similar
              algorithm to that of (Yarowsky 95), with modifications motivated
              by (Blum and Mitchell 98). The second algorithm extends ideas from
              boosting algorithms, designed for supervised learning tasks, to
              the framework suggested by (Blum and Mitchell 98).",

                 our knowledge, no national study has evaluated rates of burnout
                 among US physicians, explored differences by specialty, or
                 compared physicians with US workers in other fields. METHODS:
                 We conducted a national study of burnout in a large sample of
                 US physicians from all specialty disciplines using the American
                 Medical Association Physician Masterfile and surveyed a
                 probability-based sample of the general US population for
                 comparison. Burnout was measured using validated instruments.
                 Satisfaction with work-life balance was explored. RESULTS: Of
                 27 276 physicians who received an invitation to participate,
                 7288 (26.7\%) completed surveys. When assessed using the
                 Maslach Burnout Inventory, 45.8\% of physicians reported at
                 least 1 symptom of burnout. Substantial differences in burnout
                 were observed by specialty, with the highest rates among
                 physicians at the front line of care access (family medicine,
                 general internal medicine, and emergency medicine). Compared
                 with a probability-based sample of 3442 working US adults,
                 physicians were more likely to have symptoms of burnout (37.9\%
                 vs 27.8\%) and to be dissatisfied with work-life balance
                 (40.2\% vs 23.2\%) (P < .001 for both). Highest level of
                 education completed also related to burnout in a pooled
                 multivariate analysis adjusted for age, sex, relationship
                 status, and hours worked per week. Compared with high school
                 graduates, individuals with an MD or DO degree were at
                 increased risk for burnout (odds ratio [OR], 1.36; P < .001),
                 whereas individuals with a bachelor's degree (OR, 0.80; P =
                 .048), master's degree (OR, 0.71; P = .01), or professional or
                 doctoral degree other than an MD or DO degree (OR, 0.64; P =
                 .04) were at lower risk for burnout. CONCLUSIONS: Burnout is
                 more common among physicians than among other US workers.
                 Physicians in specialties at the front line of care access seem
                 to be at greatest risk.",

                 Medicine practiced with narrative competence, called narrative
                 medicine, is proposed as a model for humane and effective
                 medical practice. Adopting methods such as close reading of

                 physician and colleagues, and physicians and society. With
                 narrative competence, physicians can reach and join their

                 through medicine, acknowledge kinship with and duties toward
                 other health care professionals, and inaugurate consequential

                 divides that separate physicians from patients, themselves,

  abstract    = "IMPORTANCE: The rapid expansion of virtual health care has
                 caused a surge in patient messages concomitant with more work
                 and burnout among health care professionals. Artificial
                 intelligence (AI) assistants could potentially aid in creating
                 answers to patient questions by drafting responses that could
                 be reviewed by clinicians. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the ability
                 of an AI chatbot assistant (ChatGPT), released in November
                 2022, to provide quality and empathetic responses to patient
                 questions. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this
                 cross-sectional study, a public and nonidentifiable database of
                 questions from a public social media forum (Reddit's r/AskDocs)
                 was used to randomly draw 195 exchanges from October 2022 where
                 a verified physician responded to a public question. Chatbot
                 responses were generated by entering the original question into
                 a fresh session (without prior questions having been asked in
                 the session) on December 22 and 23, 2022. The original question
                 along with anonymized and randomly ordered physician and
                 chatbot responses were evaluated in triplicate by a team of
                 licensed health care professionals. Evaluators chose ``which
                 response was better'' and judged both ``the quality of
                 information provided'' (very poor, poor, acceptable, good, or
                 very good) and ``the empathy or bedside manner provided'' (not
                 empathetic, slightly empathetic, moderately empathetic,
                 empathetic, and very empathetic). Mean outcomes were ordered on
                 a 1 to 5 scale and compared between chatbot and physicians.
                 RESULTS: Of the 195 questions and responses, evaluators
                 preferred chatbot responses to physician responses in 78.6\%
                 (95\% CI, 75.0\%-81.8\%) of the 585 evaluations. Mean (IQR)
                 physician responses were significantly shorter than chatbot
                 responses (52 [17-62] words vs 211 [168-245] words; t = 25.4; P
                 < .001). Chatbot responses were rated of significantly higher
                 quality than physician responses (t = 13.3; P < .001). The
                 proportion of responses rated as good or very good quality
                 ($\geq{}$ 4), for instance, was higher for chatbot than
                 physicians (chatbot: 78.5\%, 95\% CI, 72.3\%-84.1\%;
                 physicians: 22.1\%, 95\% CI, 16.4\%-28.2\%;). This amounted to
                 3.6 times higher prevalence of good or very good quality
                 responses for the chatbot. Chatbot responses were also rated
                 significantly more empathetic than physician responses (t =
                 18.9; P < .001). The proportion of responses rated empathetic
                 or very empathetic ($\geq{}$4) was higher for chatbot than for
                 physicians (physicians: 4.6\%, 95\% CI, 2.1\%-7.7\%; chatbot:
                 45.1\%, 95\% CI, 38.5\%-51.8\%; physicians: 4.6\%, 95\% CI,
                 2.1\%-7.7\%). This amounted to 9.8 times higher prevalence of
                 empathetic or very empathetic responses for the chatbot.
                 CONCLUSIONS: In this cross-sectional study, a chatbot generated
                 quality and empathetic responses to patient questions posed in
                 an online forum. Further exploration of this technology is
                 warranted in clinical settings, such as using chatbot to draft
                 responses that physicians could then edit. Randomized trials
                 could assess further if using AI assistants might improve
                 responses, lower clinician burnout, and improve patient
                 outcomes.",

              with menopause; Study II examined posts from two online discussion
              groups for people with symptoms of obsessive compulsive disorder.
              Joint data analysis demonstrates that normality was initially
              perceived as the absence of illness. A breakdown in perceived
              normality because of disruptive symptoms created gaps and
              discontinuities in understanding. As participants interacted with
              information about the experiences of health-challenged peers,
              socially constructed notions of normality emerged. This was
              internalized as a ?new normal.? Findings demonstrate normality as
              an element of sense making that changes and develops over time,
              and experiential information and social contexts as central to
              health-related sense making. Re-establishing perceptions of
              normality, as experienced by health-challenged peers, was an
              important element of sense making. This investigation provides
              nuanced insight into notions of normality, extends understanding
              of social processes involved in sense making, and represents the

              Introduction When information is shared in social settings, such
              as online communities, the surrounding connections and context
              must be accounted for. Social norms, information values,
              information behaviours, activities, organizations, and most
              notably community boundaries all have important sociotechnical
              impacts (Jaeger \& Burnett, 2010; Meyer, 2014; Sawyer \& Jarrahi,
              2014; Star \& Griesemer, 1989), especially when an online
              community is centred on information. When digital libraries take
              on social aspects, akin to other information-centric online
              communities, how they are used and the roles they play for users
              within and across the boundaries of social spaces require
              exploration and understanding (Lynch, 2005; Marshall \& Bly, 2004;
              Star, Bowker, \& Neumann, 2003; Van House, 2003). They may act as
              boundary objects (Star \& Griesemer, 1989), facilitating the
              establishment of norms, values, and behaviours between
              communities, or the emergence of new communities around their use
              (Star et al., 2003). However, our understanding is limited of how
              a social digital library and information-centric online community
              may act as a boundary object and whether it supports this
              establishment and emergence. A significant research gap exists in
              our understanding of the systems, environments, and contexts at
              play around a social digital library as a boundary object. This
              paper presents a mixed-methods study of LibraryThing
              (librarything.com) and Goodreads (goodreads.com), which share
              characteristics of both information-centric communities and social
              digital libraries. The study's objective was to examine the
              information values and information behaviour of users; the
              boundaries and boundary objects at play; and the roles these sites
              play for users, as boundary objects themselves. Research questions
              asked about these roles and how they may or may not facilitate the
              processes of translation, coherence, and convergence--taken from
              boundary object theory (Star \& Griesemer, 1989; Star et al.,
              2003)-- between existing and of emergent communities around
              LibraryThing and Goodreads. Findings from qualitative and
              quantitative methods--including content analysis, a survey, and
              semistructured interviews--show these two sites play three key
              roles for users, with translation an important activity. Clear
              implications exist for design and practice in digital libraries
              and online communities, and for research on and theorizing of
              boundaries and boundary objects in such contexts. This paper
              begins by reviewing relevant literature on online communities,
              social digital libraries, and boundaries and boundary objects,
              with an eye to the unexplored overlaps between them. CONNECTIONS

  abstract = "Abstract In this paper the purpose and use of centering and
              scaling are discussed in depth. The main focus is on two-way
              bilinear data analysis, but the results can easily be generalized
              to multiway data analysis. In fact, one of the scopes of this
              paper is to show that if two-way centering and scaling are
              understood, then multiway centering and scaling is quite
              straightforward. In the literature it is often stated that
              preprocessing of multiway arrays is difficult, but here it is
              shown that most of the difficulties do not pertain to three- and
              higher-way modeling in particular. It is shown that centering is
              most conveniently seen as a projection step, where the data are
              projected onto certain well-defined spaces within a given mode.
              This view of centering helps to explain why, for example,
              centering data with missing elements is likely to be suboptimal if
              there are many missing elements. Building a model for data
              consists of two parts: postulating a structural model and using a
              method to estimate the parameters. Centering has to do with the
              first part: when centering, a model including offsets is
              postulated. Scaling has to do with the second part: when scaling,
              another way of fitting the model is employed. It is shown that
              centering is simply a convenient technique to estimate model
              parameters for models with certain offsets, but this does not work
              for all types of offsets. It is also shown that scaling is a way
              to fit models with a weighted least squares loss function and that
              sometimes this change in objective function cannot be performed by
              a simple scaling step. Further practical aspects of and
              alternatives to centering and scaling are discussed, and examples
              are used throughout to show that the conclusions in the paper are
              not only of theoretical interest but can have an impact on
              practical data analysis. Copyright ? 2003 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.",

              assigned tags with terms in corresponding MARC records. The
              results show that LT members tag mostly for personal reasons,
              especially to manage their own collection, but they also tag to
              assist others to find a book. Once assigned, LT members use the
              tags to search and retrieve books, to gain information about
              books, and most importantly, to assist with personal collection
              management. Contrary to users of other popular tagging systems
              such as Flickr, LT members do not perceive social networking as an
              important factor when assigning and using the tags. The study also
              reveals that book tags by users vary greatly from MARC records.
              When tags overlapped with the terms used in MARC records, the
              majority of the matching occurred in the fields of 600s (Subject
              Access Fields) and 245 (Title Statement). The findings of the

              defines itself as ``a marketplace for work that requires human
              intelligence.'' Early advocates and developers of crowdsourcing
              platforms argued that crowdsourcing tasks are designed so people
              of any skill level can do this labor online. However, as the
              popularity of crowdsourcing work has grown, the crowdsourcing
              literature has identified a peculiar issue: that work quality of
              workers is not responsive to changes in price. This means that
              unlike what economic theory would predict, paying crowdworkers
              higher wages does not lead to higher quality work. This has led
              some to believe that platforms, like AMT, attract poor quality
              workers. This article examines different market dynamics that
              might, unwittingly, contribute to the inefficiencies in the market
              that generate poor work quality. We argue that the cultural logics
              and socioeconomic values embedded in AMT's platform design
              generate a greater amount of market power for requesters (those
              posting tasks) than for individuals doing tasks for pay
              (crowdworkers). We attribute the uneven distribution of market
              power among participants to labor market frictions, primarily
              characterized by uncompetitive wage posting and incomplete
              information. Finally, recommendations are made for how to tackle
              these frictions when contemplating the design of an online labor
              market.",

               establishing an empirical basis for theories about religion's
               role in human evolution. Computer modeling and simulation offers
               a way to address this experimental constraint. A case study in
               this approach was conducted on a key theory within CSR that
               recently has come under serious challenge: the Supernatural
               Punishment Hypothesis, which posits religion facilitated the
               shift from small, homogeneous social units to large, complex

               proximate mechanism for cooperation into the theory may address
               these challenges. To test this, we developed a computer
               simulation that runs iterated cooperation games. To assess the

               neuroscientific literature on empathy and cooperation, that could
               be modulated by signals of religious identity. The results of

               Summaries are composed by sentences. So, the basic idea of
               composing a salient summary is to construct quality sentences
               both for user specific queries and multiple documents. Sentence
               embedding has been shown effective in summarization tasks.

              because new and surprising facets of entities become visible in

               their lives within social, cultural, and historical contexts.
               There is no set approach to undertaking a narrative inquiry, and
               a number of scholars have offered interpretations of narrative
               inquiry approaches. Various combinations have also been employed
               successfully in the literature. There are, however, limited
               detailed accounts of the actual techniques and processes
               undertaken during the analysis phase of narrative inquiry. This
               can make it difficult for researchers to know where to start (and
               stop) when they come to do narrative analysis. This chapter
               describes in detail the practical steps that can be undertaken
               within narrative analysis. Drawing on the work of Polkinghorne
               (Int J Qual Stud Educ. 8(1):5--23, 1995), both narrative analysis
               and paradigmatic analysis of narrative techniques are explored,
               as they offer equally useful insights for different purposes.
               Narrative analysis procedures reveal the constructed story of an
               individual participant, while paradigmatic analysis of narratives
               uses both inductive and deductive means to identify common and
               contrasting themes between stories. These analysis methods can be
               used separately, or in combination, depending on the aims of the
               research. Details from narrative inquiries conducted by the
               authors to reveal the stories of emerging adults with cerebral
               palsy, and families of adolescents with acquired brain inquiry,
               are used throughout the chapter to provide practical examples of
               narrative analysis techniques.",

              research over the past decades has developed comprehensive models
              to describe media bias and effective, yet often manual and thus
              cumbersome, methods for analysis. In contrast, in computer science
              fast, automated, and scalable methods are available, but few
              approaches systematically analyze media bias. The models used to
              analyze media bias in computer science tend to be simpler compared
              to models established in the social sciences, and do not
              necessarily address the most pressing substantial questions,
              despite technically superior approaches. Computer science research
              on media bias thus stands to profit from a closer integration of
              models for the study of media bias developed in the social
              sciences with automated methods from computer science. This

  abstract = "As information is available in abundance for every topic on
              internet, condensing the important information in the form of
              summary would benefit a number of users. Hence, there is growing
              interest among the research community for developing new
              approaches to automatically summarize the text. Automatic text
              summarization system generates a summary, i.e. short length text
              that includes all the important information of the document. Since
              the advent of text summarization in 1950s, researchers have been
              trying to improve techniques for generating summaries so that
              machine generated summary matches with the human made summary.
              Summary can be generated through extractive as well as abstractive
              methods. Abstractive methods are highly complex as they need
              extensive natural language processing. Therefore, research
              community is focusing more on extractive summaries, trying to
              achieve more coherent and meaningful summaries. During a decade,
              several extractive approaches have been developed for automatic
              summary generation that implements a number of machine learning
              and optimization techniques. This paper presents a comprehensive
              survey of recent text summarization extractive approaches
              developed in the last decade. Their needs are identified and their
              advantages and disadvantages are listed in a comparative manner. A
              few abstractive and multilingual text summarization approaches are
              also covered. Summary evaluation is another challenging issue in
              this research field. Therefore, intrinsic as well as extrinsic
              both the methods of summary evaluation are described in detail
              along with text summarization evaluation conferences and
              workshops. Furthermore, evaluation results of extractive
              summarization approaches are presented on some shared DUC
              datasets. Finally this paper concludes with the discussion of
              useful future directions that can help researchers to identify

  abstract = "Recently, research on short text topic models has addressed the
              challenges of social media datasets. These models are typically
              evaluated using automated measures. However, recent work suggests
              that these evaluation measures do not inform whether the topics
              produced can yield meaningful insights for those examining social
              media data. Efforts to address this issue, including gauging the
              alignment between automated and human evaluation tasks, are
              hampered by a lack of knowledge about how researchers use topic
              models. Further problems could arise if researchers do not
              construct topic models optimally or use them in a way that exceeds
              the models' limitations. These scenarios threaten the validity of
              topic model development and the insights produced by researchers
              employing topic modelling as a methodology. However, there is
              currently a lack of information about how and why topic models are
              used in applied research. As such, we performed a systematic
              literature review of 189 articles where topic modelling was used
              for social media analysis to understand how and why topic models
              are used for social media analysis. Our results suggest that the
              development of topic models is not aligned with the needs of those
              who use them for social media analysis. We have found that
              researchers use topic models sub-optimally. There is a lack of
              methodological support for researchers to build and interpret
              topics. We offer a set of recommendations for topic model
              researchers to address these problems and bridge the gap between

              high-dimensional data by giving each datapoint a location in a two
              or three-dimensional map. The technique is a variation of
              Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (Hinton and Roweis, 2002) that is
              much easier to optimize, and produces significantly better
              visualizations by reducing the tendency to crowd points together
              in the center of the map. t-SNE is better than existing techniques
              at creating a single map that reveals structure at many different
              scales. This is particularly important for high-dimensional data
              that lie on several different, but related, low-dimensional
              manifolds, such as images of objects from multiple classes seen
              from multiple viewpoints. For visualizing the structure of very
              large data sets, we show how t-SNE can use random walks on
              neighborhood graphs to allow the implicit structure of all of the
              data to influence theway in which a subset of the data is
              displayed. We illustrate the performance of t-SNE on a wide

              visualization techniques, including Sammon mapping, Isomap, and
              Locally Linear Embedding. The visualiza- tions produced by t-SNE

                 Fricker (Epistemic injustice. Power and the ethics of knowing.
                 Oxford University Press, Oxford, 2007). Ill persons are
                 vulnerable to testimonial injustice through the presumptive
                 attribution of characteristics like cognitive unreliability and
                 emotional instability that downgrade the credibility of their
                 testimonies. Ill persons are also vulnerable to hermeneutical
                 injustice because many aspects of the experience of illness are
                 difficult to understand and communicate and this often owes to
                 gaps in collective hermeneutical resources. We then argue that
                 epistemic injustice arises in part owing to the epistemic
                 privilege enjoyed by the practitioners and institutions of
                 contemporary healthcare services--the former owing to their
                 training, expertise, and third-person psychology, and the
                 latter owing to their implicit privileging of certain styles of
                 articulating and evidencing testimonies in ways that

              rational interpretation and affective valorization of key game

              uncertainty and tentativeness about academic knowledge. However,
              few studies explore how hedges have changed in academic writing
              overtime. Among the existing studies, there is also divergent
              understandings. The current case study traced the diachronic
              development of hedges that express doubt and uncertainty in the
              full texts of Science research articles from 1997 to 2021. Our
              findings show that the use of such hedges has significantly
              decreased in the past 25 years in the research articles of the
              Journal Science. In addition, we propose that the drop of such
              hedges in Science research articles may be an implicit writing
              strategy for research promotion, and therefore may correlate with
              the rising linguistic positivity in academic writing. Our
              hypothesis was initially confirmed by the significant correlation
              between the evolution of hedges and Yuan and Yao's (Scientometrics
              127:1--17, 2022) sentiment scores in academic writing. Our
              findings may reveal a bigger picture of promoting research by
              adopting not only explicit strategies such as more positive
              language (Yuan and Yao in Scientometrics 127:1--17, 2022) but also
              subtle and implicit writing strategies such as reducing

              personality and trust have significant effects on such

              under uncertainty and cognitive load conditions. A user study of
              42 subjects in a repeated factorial design experiment found that
              uncertainty presentation led to increased trust but only under low
              cognitive load conditions when users had sufficient cognitive
              resources to process the information. Presentation of uncertainty
              under high load conditions led to a decrease in trust. When
              further drilling down into personality trait groups of users,
              overall, users with low Openness showed the highest trust.
              Furthermore, under the low cognitive load condition, it was found
              that the trust was enhanced under ambiguity uncertainty with low
              Agreeableness, low Neuroticism, high Extraversion, high
              Conscientiousness, and high Openness. Under the high cognitive

              the trust without the uncertainty presentation. The results

              content to offer engaging and rewarding experience to its members.
              As a result, stimulating user communication and self-disclosure is
              vital for the sustainability of SNSs. However, considering that
              the SNS users are increasingly culturally diverse, motivating this
              audience to self-disclose requires understanding of their cultural
              intricacies. Yet existing research offers only limited insights
              into the role of culture behind the motivation of SNS users to
              self-disclose. Building on the privacy calculus framework, this
              study explores the role of two cultural dimensions --
              individualism and uncertainty avoidance -- in self-disclosure
              decisions of SNS users. Survey responses of US and German Facebook
              members are used as the basis for our analysis. Structural
              equation modeling and multi-group analysis results reveal the
              distinct role of culture in the cognitive patterns of SNS users.
              The authors find that trusting beliefs play a key role in the
              self-disclosure decisions of users from individualistic cultures.
              At the same time, uncertainty avoidance determines the impact of
              privacy concerns. This paper contributes to the theory by
              rejecting the universal nature of privacy calculus processes. The
              findings provide for an array of managerial implications for SNS

                 and containment, or on the long-term social and economic
                 ramifications of the pandemic. Among the stories currently
                 circulating in US-focused social media forums are ones
                 suggesting that the 5G telecommunication network activates the
                 virus, that the pandemic is a hoax perpetrated by a global
                 cabal, that the virus is a bio-weapon released deliberately by
                 the Chinese, or that Bill Gates is using it as cover to launch
                 a broad vaccination program to facilitate a global surveillance
                 regime. While some may be quick to dismiss these stories as

                 masks and practice social distancing, countermand such
                 conclusions. Inspired by narrative theory, we crawl social
                 media sites and news reports and, through the application of
                 automated machine-learning methods, discover the underlying

               content and structure of values, concentrating on the theoretical
               advances and empirical tests in 20 countries, and its four basic
               issues: substantive contents of human values; identification of
               comprehensive set of values; extent to which the meaning of
               particular values was equivalent for different groups of people;
               and how the relations among different values was structured.
               Substantial progress has been made toward resolving each of these
               issues. Ten motivationally distinct value types that were likely
               to be recognized within and across cultures and used to form
               value priorities were identified. Set of value types that was
               relatively comprehensive, encompassing virtually all the types of
               values to which individuals attribute at least moderate
               importance as criteria of evaluation was demonstrated. The
               evidence from 20 countries was assembled, showing that the
               meaning of the value types and most of the single values that
               constitute them was reasonably equivalent across most groups. Two
               basic dimensions that organize value systems into an integrated
               motivational structure with consistent value conflicts and
               compatibilities were discovered. By identifying universal aspects
               of value content and structure, the chapter has laid the
               foundations for investigating culture-specific aspects in the

                 toxically assaulted communities in the US who have suffered

                 women's natural inborn powers to reproduce) exacerbates the

                 related to a broader ``culture of meritocracy'' which

                 detrimental effect of computerized physician order entry (CPOE)
                 on throughput time and patient satisfaction (Ann of Emer Med,
                 Vol 56, P S83-S84). To address these quality metrics, we
                 conducted a pilot program using scribes in the emergency
                 department (ED). METHODS: We conducted a before-and-after study
                 of ED throughput at our 320-bed suburban community hospital
                 with a census of 70000 annual visits. Our primary outcome
                 measure was the effect of scribes on ED throughput as measured
                 by the effect on (1) door-to-room time; (2) room-to-doc time;
                 (3) door-to-doc time; (4) doc-to-dispo time; and (5) length of
                 stay for discharged/admitted patients, between pre-CPOE and
                 post-CPOE cohorts. Our secondary outcome measure was patient
                 satisfaction as provided by Press Ganey surveys. Data were
                 analyzed using descriptive statistics, and means were compared
                 using a standard t test. RESULTS: Patient data from a total of
                 11729 patients in the before cohort were compared with data
                 from 12609 patients in the after cohort. Despite a 7.5 \%
                 increase in volume between the post-CPOE and post-scribe
                 cohorts, all throughput metrics improved in the post-scribe
                 cohort. This process improved the overall door-to-doc time to
                 61 minutes in the after cohort from 74 minutes in the before
                 cohort. Furthermore, patient and physician satisfaction was

  abstract    = "BACKGROUND: Contraceptive method choice is often strongly
                 influenced by the experiences and opinions of one's social
                 network. Although social media, including Twitter, increasingly
                 influences reproductive-age individuals, discussion of
                 contraception in this setting has yet to be characterized.
                 Natural language processing, a type of machine learning in
                 which computers analyze natural language data, enables this
                 analysis. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to illuminate temporal
                 trends in attitudes toward long- and short-acting reversible
                 contraceptive methods in tweets between 2006 and 2019 and
                 establish social media platforms as alternate data sources for
                 large-scale sentiment analysis on contraception. STUDY DESIGN:
                 We studied English-language tweets mentioning reversible
                 prescription contraceptive methods between March 2006 (founding
                 of Twitter) and December 2019. Tweets mentioning contraception
                 were extracted using search terms, including generic or brand
                 names, colloquial names, and abbreviations. We characterized
                 and performed sentiment analysis on tweets. We used
                 Mann-Kendall nonparametric tests to assess temporal trends in
                 the overall number and the number of positive, negative, and
                 neutral tweets referring to each method. The code to reproduce
                 this analysis is available at
                 https://github.com/hms-dbmi/contraceptionOnTwitter. RESULTS: We
                 extracted 838,739 tweets mentioning at least 1 contraceptive
                 method. The annual number of contraception-related tweets
                 increased considerably over the study period. The intrauterine
                 device was the most commonly referenced method (45.9\%).
                 Long-acting methods were mentioned more often than short-acting
                 ones (58\% vs 42\%), and the annual proportion of long-acting
                 reversible contraception-related tweets increased over time. In
                 sentiment analysis of tweets mentioning a single contraceptive
                 method (n=665,064), the greatest proportion of all tweets was
                 negative (65,339 of 160,713 tweets with at least 95\% confident
                 sentiment, or 40.66\%). Tweets mentioning long-acting methods
                 were nearly twice as likely to be positive compared with tweets
                 mentioning short-acting methods (19.65\% vs 10.21\%; P<.002).
                 CONCLUSION: Recognizing the influence of social networks on
                 contraceptive decision making, social media platforms may be
                 useful in the collection and dissemination of information about
                 contraception.",

                 expressions and unrelated pairs of words were studied in a
                 group of 15 normal adults using fMRI. Subjects read the four
                 types of linguistic expressions and decided which relation
                 exists between the two words (metaphoric, literal, or
                 unrelated). According to the Graded Salience Hypothesis (GSH,
                 ), which predicts a selective RH involvement in the processing
                 of novel, nonsalient meanings, it is primarily the degree of
                 meaning salience of a linguistic expression rather than
                 literality or nonliterality, which modulates the degree of left
                 hemisphere (LH) and right hemisphere (RH) processing of
                 metaphors. In the present study, novel metaphorical expressions
                 represented the nonsalient interpretations, whereas
                 conventional metaphors and literal expressions represented the
                 salient interpretations. A direct comparison of the novel
                 metaphors vs. the conventional metaphors revealed significantly
                 stronger activity in right posterior superior temporal sulcus,
                 right inferior frontal gyrus, and left middle frontal gyrus.
                 These results support the GSH and suggest a special role for
                 the RH in processing novel metaphors. Furthermore, the right
                 PSTS may be selectively involved in verbal creativity.",

              social capital in online-gaming. In contrast to most existing
              studies, our study asks for crucial underlying factors of social
              capital acquisition and thereby includes players of online-games
              of different genres to allow comparisons. We hypothesize that
              frequently playing together (familiarity), participating in
              offline events (physical proximity) and being involved in
              clan/guild administration (social proximity) lead to more
              communication with fellow players and foster self-disclosure
              towards fellow players, which together facilitates the formation
              of bridging and bonding social capital. A sample of 682 clan/guild
              players of the games Counter-Strike and World of Warcraft was
              recruited via Internet and was asked to fill out a questionnaire.
              Results of a path analysis support our assumptions and enhance
              previous findings that players of online-games especially gain
              positive social outcomes, when they go beyond the game and join
              game-related groups, engage in clan/guild administration and
              participate in offline events. By revealing the crucial role of
              self-disclosure and communication frequency as underlying factors
              of social capital acquisition in online-gaming, our results
              provide a deeper insight into these mechanisms than existing

               Internet activity lessens lonely individuals' felt distress
               (known as positive psychosocial ``compensation''), or by contrast
               further magnifies it (the ``poor-get-poorer'' hypothesis).
               Focused on online videogames in particular, we use qualitative
               cultural psychiatric interviews (N = 20) and path analysis of
               online survey data (N = 3629) to model pathways connecting
               loneliness, videogame involvement, and positive and negative
               online gaming experiences. Informed by social signaling theory,
               we hypothesize that lonely individuals who are intensively
               involved in online videogames (as opposed to playing casually)
               will experience more positive play experiences, given the way
               that such gamers' costly expenditures of time, energy, and
               resources ``signal'' their commitment and also their insiderness
               to gaming communities, thus fostering for them a greater sense of

               to engage videogames in this intensive and socially supportive
               manner can instead compound their life distress with additional
               problems related to their online play. Ironically, it is thus
               gamers displaying dimensions of what seems on the surface to be
               ``addictive'' play--but is better described in this context as
               intensive gaming involvement--who experience the greatest

                 little is known about women's information-seeking behavior
                 after receiving prescriptions for medication. STUDY DESIGN: All
                 reproductive-age women who visited one of four primary care
                 clinics in Western Pennsylvania between October 2008 and April
                 2010 were invited to complete a follow-up survey after their
                 visit which included questions regarding medications
                 prescribed, information-seeking after their visit and their
                 perceptions of the quality of the information they found.
                 RESULTS: Of the 218 women prescribed contraceptives, 49\%
                 sought additional information after their visit. In models
                 adjusted for sociodemographic and reproductive characteristics
                 of the respondents, women who received a contraceptive
                 prescription were twice as likely to seek additional
                 information about their medication as women who received
                 noncontraceptive prescriptions [odds ratio (OR)=2.06, 95\%
                 confidence interval (CI) 1.47-2.90]. Women who received a
                 contraceptive prescription were more likely to seek information
                 from the Internet (OR=1.84, 95\% CI 1.26-2.70) and from the

                 received noncontraceptive prescriptions. CONCLUSIONS: Women
                 frequently sought additional information on contraceptive

                 adults, especially by groups with histories of sexual risk
                 involvement. STUDY DESIGN: Nationally representative data from
                 1800 unmarried young adults, aged 18-29 years, were analyzed to
                 (1) examine the sources of contraceptive information most
                 frequently used by young adults and (2) assess variations (if
                 any) in source use based on demographic characteristics and
                 sexual risk history (determined based on past sexual
                 behaviors). RESULTS: ``Doctors/nurses'' was the most frequently
                 used contraceptive information source reported by young adults.
                 Significant variations existed in source use based on
                 demographic characteristics and sexual risk history. Females
                 were more likely to obtain contraceptive information from
                 health care professionals, whereas males were more likely to
                 report friends, partners, internet and television/radio as
                 their frequently used source. Young adults with a sexual risk

                 with greater accuracy in knowledge about contraceptive use and
                 efficacy as compared to all other sources. CONCLUSIONS: Young
                 adults' use of specific contraceptive information sources can
                 vary based on their demographic characteristics and sexual risk
                 involvement. Future research should identify better strategies

                 risk histories to more reliable sources of information.",

                 contraception journey from her first prescribed method to her
                 current one including reasons for choosing and
                 stopping/switching methods, healthcare provider relationships,
                 and bleeding preferences. STUDY DESIGN: We administered a
                 nationally-representative, web-based survey of US women aged 16
                 to 50 years currently using (N=1656) or had previously used
                 (N=1448) prescription contraception, or who had never used it
                 but would consider using it in the future (N=103). Statistical
                 analyses were based on overlap formulae with sample weights
                 adjusted to 2010 US census demographic benchmarks. RESULTS: The
                 survey was sent to 11,906 women, and 5957 responded (50\%
                 response rate). Among qualified respondents, 3104 had
                 experience with prescription contraception. Oral contraceptives
                 (OC) remain the most frequently prescribed method as first or
                 subsequent contraception. However, as women switch to their
                 current prescription method, more chose IUD contraception. As
                 reported by respondents, only 48\% of current users received
                 counseling on how to use specific methods, and 58\% were
                 counseled on bleeding patterns to expect, while 67\% were
                 offered counseling on potential side effects. Many of the side
                 effects reported in this study for first and current
                 prescription contraception were nonspecific and may be related
                 to a nocebo effect, lack of understanding about normal bodily
                 fluctuations, or poor compliance. Many women (34\%) reported
                 'making their periods lighter' as a reason for using their
                 current prescription method, and 53\% would prefer to skip
                 their monthly period altogether. CONCLUSIONS: Misperceptions
                 about contraception are common, and prescription contraception
                 choice can be quite complex. Clinicians can enhance patient
                 satisfaction by providing adequate information and matching
                 methods to women's lifestyles, reproductive choices, and
                 pregnancy risk. IMPLICATIONS: This study provides insight into
                 modern women's attitudes and views toward prescription
                 contraception that may be important to clinicians and women
                 themselves.",

                 of Google searches emerging from the United States for the
                 three most popular reversible contraceptive methods - oral
                 contraceptives, intrauterine devices (IUDs) and condoms - from
                 January 1, 2004, through October 31, 2017 (1 year after the
                 presidential election). RESULTS: IUD searches were cumulatively
                 15\% (95\% CI: 10 to 20) higher than expected the year
                 following the 2016 election, reflecting 10 to 21 million excess
                 searches. IUD searches were statistically significantly higher
                 in all states, except NV, and were consistent across states won
                 by Trump or Clinton (Welch t test=0.60, p=.548). Conversely,
                 searches for oral contraceptives and condoms remained stable
                 (0\%; 95\% CI: -2 to 1) or declined (-4\%; 95\% CI: -5 to -2),
                 respectively, following the election. CONCLUSIONS: The etiology
                 of increased searches for IUDs is likely multifaceted. However,
                 it may largely be because IUDs will confer continued protection
                 even after an ACA repeal, thereby providing a medical hedge
                 against a possible repeal. Regardless, these data suggest the
                 heightened focus on an ACA repeal is a concern to the record
                 number of Americans seeking out information about IUDs.",

                 a popular video-sharing website. STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a
                 comprehensive keyword search of YouTube videos related to
                 self-removal of LARC-namely intrauterine devices and implants.
                 We analyzed video content to explore demographic
                 characteristics, method and duration of LARC use, and
                 motivations and experiences of self-removal. RESULTS: Our
                 keyword search identified 58 videos that met the criteria for
                 inclusion, including 48 videos that featured individuals who
                 removed an intrauterine device and 10 who removed an implant.
                 Collectively, videos had over 4 million views. We identified
                 most video creators as white (53\%), 31\% as Black, and 14\% as
                 Latinx. Users were motivated to remove their own device by both
                 preferences and barriers to formal care. Most individuals in
                 our sample (n = 56/58) successfully removed their device and
                 described their experience in positive terms related to the
                 ease of removal. Reasons for LARC discontinuation included
                 negative side effects, fear of potential side effects, and
                 desire for pregnancy. CONCLUSION: This study builds upon prior
                 research by describing publicly available information about
                 LARC self-removal. The over representation of Black women in
                 our sample may reflect a higher prevalence of LARC self-removal
                 among this population. Positive experiences of self-removal and
                 high levels of viewer engagement with online videos suggest a
                 need for provider counseling on LARC removal at the time of
                 insertion. IMPLICATIONS: Prior to LARC insertion, patients
                 should be made aware of any financial requirements for
                 discontinuation. Provider counseling for self-removal at the
                 time of insertion will likely minimize health risks and affirm

              way of finding relevant information in large text libraries or in
              the Internet. Essentially, text summarization techniques are

              perform text summarization by selecting sentences of documents

              improve the coherence among sentences by eliminating redundancies
              and clarifying the contest of sentences. In terms of extractive
              summarization, sentence scoring is the technique most used for
              extractive text summarization. This paper describes and performs a
              quantitative and qualitative assessment of 15 algorithms for
              sentence scoring available in the literature. Three different

              psychological detachment from work, relaxation, mastery
              experiences and a sense of control, all of which have been argued
              to be assisted by digital game use. However, it is unclear whether

              genres, or whether this would extend to other recovery-related
              outcomes, for instance work home interference (WHI), where the
              stress from work interferes with home-life. These factors may be
              vital in determining whether interventions aimed at improving

              games per week was positively correlated with overall recovery.
              Correlations varied with genre, highlighting the importance of
              game characteristics in this relationship: first person shooters
              and action games were most highly correlated with recovery.

              features are extracted by measuring the similarity distance of
              domain vectors. A domain vector is derived based on the
              association values between a feature and comparative domain
              corpora. A novel term similarity measure (PMI--TFIDF) is
              introduced to evaluate the association of candidate features and

              extraction outperforms other state-of-the-art methods, and the
              only external resources used are comparative domain corpora.
              Therefore, it is generic and unsupervised. Compared with
              traditional pointwise mutual information (PMI), PMI--TFIDF showed

               received emails are spam. Historical approaches to combating

              reduction offered by text summarization is particularly useful in
              the biomedical domain, where physicians must continuously find

              high-volume of publications. This paper presents two independent
              methods (BioChain and FreqDist) for identifying salient sentences
              in biomedical texts using concepts derived from domain-specific
              resources. Our semantic-based method (BioChain) is effective at
              identifying thematic sentences, while our frequency-distribution
              method (FreqDist) removes information redundancy. The two methods
              are then combined to form a hybrid method (ChainFreq). An
              evaluation of each method is performed using the ROUGE system to

                 popular forums with active users interested in dermatology.
                 Techniques within natural language processing, a field of
                 artificial intelligence, can analyze large amounts of text
                 information and extract insights. OBJECTIVE: To apply natural
                 language processing to Reddit comments about dermatology topics
                 to assess for feasibility and potential for insights and
                 engagement. METHODS: A software pipeline preprocessed Reddit
                 comments from 2005 to 2017 from 7 popular dermatology-related
                 subforums on Reddit, applied latent Dirichlet allocation, and
                 used spectral clustering to establish cohesive themes and the
                 frequency of word representation and grouped terms within these
                 topics. RESULTS: We created a corpus of 176,000 comments and
                 identified trends in patient engagement in spaces such as
                 eczema and acne, among others, with a focus on homeopathic
                 treatments and isotretinoin. LIMITATIONS: Latent Dirichlet
                 allocation is an unsupervised model, meaning there is no ground
                 truth to which the model output can be compared. However,
                 because these forums are anonymous, there seems little
                 incentive for patients to be dishonest. CONCLUSIONS: Reddit
                 data has viability and utility for dermatologic research and
                 engagement with the public, especially for common dermatology
                 topics such as tanning, acne, and psoriasis.",

               interview data.ResultsIn this cohort of African American (63\%)
               and Hispanic (37\%) women (median age, 26), 73\% had unplanned
               pregnancies. The social network, including friends, mothers, and
               partners, were key sources of contraception myths,
               misconceptions, and vicarious experiences. Women also utilized
               media, including the internet, as an additional source of
               information. Information relayed by the social network had a
               direct influence on contraceptive decisions for many
               women.ConclusionsThe experiences and opinions of the social
               network influence contraceptive decisions in this population of
               young, minority women. The social network, including friends,
               family members, and media sources, is a key source of
               contraceptive information for many women. Comprehensive
               contraception counseling should explore the experiences and
               opinions of the patient's social network to the extent possible.",

               fundamental task of biomedical text mining. Biomedical named
               entities include mentions of proteins, genes, DNA, RNA, etc which
               often have complex structures, but it is challenging to identify
               and classify such entities. Machine learning methods like CRF,
               MEMM and SVM have been widely used for learning to recognize such
               entities from an annotated corpus. The identification of
               appropriate feature templates and the selection of the important
               feature values play a very important role in the success of these
               methods. In this paper, we provide a study on word clustering and
               selection based feature reduction approaches for named entity
               recognition using a maximum entropy classifier. The
               identification and selection of features are largely done

                 mention to a concept in a controlled vocabulary, typically to
                 the standard thesaurus in the Unified Medical Language System

                 texts coming from the lay public. To bridge this gap, we use

               investigate the geographies associated with some of the key
               aesthetic terms historically used in writing about the English
               Lake District: a culturally prestigious region of lakes and
               mountains in northwest England. The basis of this investigation
               is a corpus of travel writing and topographical literature about
               the Lake District containing more than 1.5 million words. The
               corpus mainly consists of works from the eighteenth and
               nineteenth centuries. In investigating this corpus we identify
               and analyse a correspondence between eighteenth-century aesthetic

                 qualitative in-depth interviews with 17 primiparous women in
                 British Columbia, Canada. Interviews revealed the influence of
                 socially circulated birth stories and cultural narratives on
                 their attitudes towards mode of delivery. Participants included
                 in their decision making process both medical information and
                 informal birth stories that were technologically inclined and

                 during the clinical encounter brings not only benefits but also
                 barriers that may affect the doctor-patient relationship and
                 increase the work burden of the physician. We evaluated whether
                 the use of an electronic medical record scribe in an academic
                 urology program would ameliorate these problems. MATERIALS AND
                 METHODS: We randomly assigned electronic medical record scribes
                 to the office hours of 5 academic urologists, and using surveys
                 we evaluated patient and physician acceptance and satisfaction.
                 RESULTS: Patients were accepting of an electronic medical
                 record scribe and satisfaction rates were high (93\% vs 87\% in
                 the absence of a scribe, p = 0.36). Patients were comfortable
                 disclosing urological information in the presence of the
                 scribe. Physicians were dramatically more satisfied with office
                 hours when a scribe was present (69\% vs 19\%, p <0.001). We
                 were unable to determine whether the presence of a scribe
                 improves productivity. CONCLUSIONS: Electronic medical record
                 scribes in a urology practice may be a practical solution to
                 provide documentation while maintaining or improving the
                 doctor-patient relationship because they increase physician
                 satisfaction and do not detract from patient satisfaction.",

                 satisfaction with work-life balance in physicians and US
                 workers in 2014 relative to 2011. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From
                 August 28, 2014, to October 6, 2014, we surveyed both US
                 physicians and a probability-based sample of the general US
                 population using the methods and measures used in our 2011
                 study. Burnout was measured using validated metrics, and
                 satisfaction with work-life balance was assessed using standard
                 tools. RESULTS: Of the 35,922 physicians who received an
                 invitation to participate, 6880 (19.2\%) completed surveys.
                 When assessed using the Maslach Burnout Inventory, 54.4\%
                 (n=3680) of the physicians reported at least 1 symptom of
                 burnout in 2014 compared with 45.5\% (n=3310) in 2011 (P<.001).
                 Satisfaction with work-life balance also declined in physicians
                 between 2011 and 2014 (48.5\% vs 40.9\%; P<.001). Substantial
                 differences in rates of burnout and satisfaction with work-life
                 balance were observed by specialty. In contrast to the trends
                 in physicians, minimal changes in burnout or satisfaction with
                 work-life balance were observed between 2011 and 2014 in
                 probability-based samples of working US adults, resulting in an
                 increasing disparity in burnout and satisfaction with work-life
                 balance in physicians relative to the general US working
                 population. After pooled multivariate analysis adjusting for
                 age, sex, relationship status, and hours worked per week,
                 physicians remained at an increased risk of burnout (odds
                 ratio, 1.97; 95\% CI, 1.80-2.16; P<.001) and were less likely
                 to be satisfied with work-life balance (odds ratio, 0.68; 95\%
                 CI, 0.62-0.75; P<.001). CONCLUSION: Burnout and satisfaction
                 with work-life balance in US physicians worsened from 2011 to
                 2014. More than half of US physicians are now experiencing
                 professional burnout.",

              summarization is attracting increasing attention in natural
              language processing. A large body of recent literature has
              implemented document summarization by extracting sentences that
              cover the main topics of a document with a minimum redundancy. In
              this paper, we take a different perspective from data
              reconstruction and propose a novel unsupervised framework named
              Document Summarization based on Data Reconstruction (DSDR).
              Specifically, our approach generates a summary which consist of
              those sentences that can best reconstruct the original document.
              To model the relationship among sentences, we firstly introduce
              the linear reconstruction which approximates the document by
              linear combinations of the selected sentences. We then extend it
              into the non-negative reconstruction which allows only additive,
              not subtractive, linear combinations. In order to handle the
              nonlinear cases and respect the geometrical structure of sentence
              space, we also extend the linear reconstruction in the manifold
              adaptive kernel space which incorporates the manifold structure by
              using graph Laplacian. Extensive experiments on summarization

                 with information about two cancer patients and asked to answer
                 key questions. For each clinician, the information on one of
                 the patients comprised their official hospital records, and for
                 the other patient it comprised summaries that were
                 computer-generated by a natural language generation system from
                 data extracted from the official records. We measured the
                 accuracy of the clinicians' responses to the questions, the
                 time they took to complete them, and recorded their attitude to
                 the computer-generated summaries. RESULTS: Results showed no
                 significant difference in the accuracy of responses to the
                 computer-generated records over the official records, but a
                 significant difference in the time taken to assess the

              from eBays clothing and shoes categories, our bootstrapped NER
              system is able to identify new brands corresponding to spelling
              variants and typographical errors of the known brands, as well as
              identifying novel brands. Among the top 300 new brands predicted,
              our system achieves 90.33\% precision. To output normalized
              attribute values, we explore several string comparison algorithms
              and found n-gram substring matching to work well in practice",

               which a model is constructed to describe ``normal'' training
               data. The novelty detection approach is typically used when the
               quantity of available ``abnormal'' data is insufficient to
               construct explicit models for non-normal classes. Application
               includes inference in datasets from critical systems, where the

               ``normality'' may be accurately modelled. In this review we aim

                 often minimized by family, friends, and the community, leaving
                 bereaved parents with unmet need for support. This study sought
                 to describe demographics, usage patterns, and perceived
                 benefits for women participating in Internet pregnancy loss
                 support groups. METHODS: We requested permission to post an
                 anonymous Internet survey on large and active United States
                 Internet message boards for women with miscarriages and
                 stillbirths. The study purposefully oversampled stillbirth
                 sites and included both closed- and open-ended questions. The
                 University of Michigan Institutional Review Board approved the
                 study. Closed-ended questions were summarized and evaluated
                 with bivariate analysis. We performed a qualitative analysis of
                 open-ended data using an iterative coding process to identify
                 key themes. RESULTS: Of 62 sites queried, 15 granted permission
                 to post the survey on 18 different message boards. We collected
                 1,039 surveys, of which 1,006 were complete and eligible for
                 analysis. Women were typically white, well educated, and
                 frequent users. They noted message boards helped them to feel
                 less isolated in their loss and grief and they appreciated
                 unique aspects of Internet communication such as convenience,
                 access, anonymity, and privacy. Pregnancy loss message boards
                 are an important aspect of support for many bereaved mothers.
                 African-American women seem to be substantially
                 underrepresented on-line despite being at higher risk for
                 stillbirth. CONCLUSION: Internet message boards serve a unique
                 function in providing support for women with miscarriage and
                 stillbirth. The benefits are often significantly different from
                 those encountered in traditional face-to-face bereavement

              investigate how Australian women use pregnancy and parenting apps,
              their attitudes about the information provided and data privacy
              and security related to such use, and what features they look for
              in these apps. Methods An online survey was completed by 410 women
              who were pregnant or had given birth to at least one child in the
              past three years, were aged between 18 and 45 and were competent
              in English. Findings The use of pregnancy and parenting apps was
              common among the respondents. Almost three quarters of respondents
              had used at least one pregnancy app; half reported using at least
              one parenting app. Respondents found the apps useful or helpful,
              particularly for providing information, monitoring foetal or child
              development and changes in their own bodies and providing
              reassurance. Yet many users were not actively assessing the
              validity of the content of these apps or considering issues
              concerning the security and privacy of the personal information
              about themselves and their children that these apps collect.
              Conclusion Apps are becoming important as a source of information
              and self-monitoring and for providing reassurance for Australian
              pregnant women and mothers with young children. Midwives and other

                 the internet to gather information to assist in decision-making

                 information about vaginal breech birth and to increase
                 understanding of how vaginal breech birth is perceived among
                 women. METHOD: A descriptive qualitative study of internet
                 discussion forums was undertaken. Google alerts were created
                 with the search terms ``breech birth'' and ``breech''. Alerts
                 were collected for a one-year period (January 2013-December
                 2013). The content of forum discussions was analysed using
                 thematic analysis. RESULTS: A total of 50 forum discussions
                 containing 382 comments were collected. Themes that arose from
                 the data were: Testing the waters-which way should I go?;
                 Losing hope for the chance of a normal birth; Seeking support
                 for options-who will listen to me?; Considering vaginal breech

                 section as a guarantee; Exploring the positive potential for
                 vaginal breech birth. CONCLUSION: Women search online for
                 information about vaginal breech birth in an attempt to come to
                 a place in their decision-making where they feel comfortable
                 with their birth plan. This study highlights the need for

                 the risks and benefits of all options for breech birth to
                 facilitate informed decision-making for the woman. This will

                 the impression that languages are all built to a common
                 pattern. In fact, there are vanishingly few universals of
                 language in the direct sense that all languages exhibit them.
                 Instead, diversity can be found at almost every level of
                 linguistic organization. This fundamentally changes the object
                 of enquiry from a cognitive science perspective. This target
                 article summarizes decades of cross-linguistic work by
                 typologists and descriptive linguists, showing just how few and
                 unprofound the universal characteristics of language are, once
                 we honestly confront the diversity offered to us by the world's
                 6,000 to 8,000 languages. After surveying the various uses of
                 ``universal,'' we illustrate the ways languages vary radically
                 in sound, meaning, and syntactic organization, and then we
                 examine in more detail the core grammatical machinery of
                 recursion, constituency, and grammatical relations. Although
                 there are significant recurrent patterns in organization, these
                 are better explained as stable engineering solutions satisfying
                 multiple design constraints, reflecting both
                 cultural-historical factors and the constraints of human
                 cognition. Linguistic diversity then becomes the crucial datum
                 for cognitive science: we are the only species with a
                 communication system that is fundamentally variable at all
                 levels. Recognizing the true extent of structural diversity in
                 human language opens up exciting new research directions for
                 cognitive scientists, offering thousands of different natural
                 experiments given by different languages, with new
                 opportunities for dialogue with biological paradigms concerned
                 with change and diversity, and confronting us with the
                 extraordinary plasticity of the highest human skills.",

               fictions produced in the last decades contain such a fictional
               world. They can be found in all fictional media, from novels
               (e.g., Lord of The Ring, Harry Potter) to films (e.g., Star Wars,
               Avatar), video games (e.g., The Legend of Zelda, Final Fantasy),
               graphic novels (e.g., One piece, Naruto) and TV series (e.g.,
               Star Trek, Game of Thrones), and they date as far back as ancient
               literature (e.g., the Cyclops Islands in The Odyssey, 850 BCE).
               Why such a success? Why so much attention devoted to nonexistent
               worlds? In this article, we propose that imaginary worlds co-opt
               our preferences for exploration, which have evolved in humans and
               non-human animals alike, to propel individuals toward new
               environments and new sources of reward. Humans would find
               imaginary worlds very attractive for the very same reasons, and
               under the same circumstances, as they are lured by unfamiliar
               environments in real life. After reviewing research on
               exploratory preferences in behavioral ecology, environmental
               aesthetics, neuroscience, and evolutionary and developmental
               psychology, we focus on the sources of their variability across
               time and space, which we argue can account for the variability of
               the cultural preference for imaginary worlds. This hypothesis can
               therefore explain the way imaginary worlds evolved culturally,
               their shape and content, their recent striking success, and their
               distribution across time and populations.",

                 radical uncertainty - situations where outcomes cannot be
                 enumerated and probabilities cannot be assigned. Whereas most
                 theories of choice assume that people rely on (potentially
                 biased) probabilistic judgments, such theories cannot account
                 for adaptive decision-making when probabilities cannot be
                 assigned. CNT proposes that people use narratives - structured
                 representations of causal, temporal, analogical, and valence
                 relationships - rather than probabilities, as the currency of
                 thought that unifies our sense-making and decision-making
                 faculties. According to CNT, narratives arise from the
                 interplay between individual cognition and the social
                 environment, with reasoners adopting a narrative that feels
                 ``right'' to explain the available data; using that narrative
                 to imagine plausible futures; and affectively evaluating those
                 imagined futures to make a choice. Evidence from many areas of
                 the cognitive, behavioral, and social sciences supports this
                 basic model, including lab experiments, interview studies, and
                 econometric analyses. We identify 12 propositions to explain
                 how the mental representations (narratives) interact with four
                 inter-related processes (explanation, simulation, affective
                 evaluation, and communication), examining the theoretical and
                 empirical basis for each. We conclude by discussing how CNT can

              a small number ofscientists to a popular phenomena affecting
              allaspects of life in industrialized nations. Scholars from
              diverse disciplines have taken aninterest in trying to understand
              the Internetand Internet users. However, as a variety
              ofresearchers have noted, guidelines for ethicalresearch on human
              subjects written before theInternet's growth can be difficult to
              extend toresearch on Internet users.In this paper, I focus on one
              ethicalissue: whether and to what extent to disguisematerial
              collected online in publishedaccounts. While some people argue
              thatvulnerable human subjects must always be madeanonymous in
              publications for their ownprotection, others argue that Internet
              usersdeserve credit for their creative andintellectual work. Still
              others argue thatmuch material available online should betreated
              as ``published.'' To attempt to resolvethese issues, I first
              review my own experiencesof disguising material in research
              accountsfrom 1992 to 2002. Some of the thorniestissues emerge at
              the boundaries betweenresearch disciplines. Furthermore,
              manyhumanities disciplines have not historicallyviewed what they
              do as human subjects research. Next, I explore what it means to do
              humansubjects research in the humanities. Inspiredby issues raised
              by colleagues in thehumanities, I argue that the traditional
              notionof a ``human subject'' does not adequatelycharacterize
              Internet users. A useful alternatemental model is proposed:
              Internet users areamateur artists. The Internet can be seen as
              aplayground for amateur artists creatingsemi-published work. I
              argue that thisapproach helps make some ethical dilemmaseasier to
              reason about, because it highlightskey novel aspects of the
              situation,particularly with regard to disguisingmaterial. Finally,
              I conclude by proposing aset of practical guidelines
              regardingdisguising material gathered on the Internet inpublished
              accounts, on a continuum from nodisguise, light disguise, moderate

              when outsiders adopt them. But while divergence is pervasive, most
              research on the propagation of culture is based on conformity.
              Consequently, it is less useful in explaining why people might
              abandon tastes when others adopt them. The 7 studies described in
              this article showed that people diverge to avoid signaling
              undesired identities. A field study, for example, found that
              undergraduates stopped wearing a particular wristband when members
              of the ``geeky'' academically focused dormitory next door started
              wearing them. Consistent with an identity-signaling perspective,

              modules but also explains how these modules are integrated to
              produce coherent cognition. The perceptual-motor modules, the goal
              module, and the declarative memory module are presented as
              examples of specialized systems in ACT-R. These modules are
              associated with distinct cortical regions. These modules place
              chunks in buffers where they can be detected by a production
              system that responds to patterns of information in the buffers. At
              any point in time, a single production rule is selected to respond
              to the current pattern. Subsymbolic processes serve to guide the
              selection of rules to fire as well as the internal operations of
              some modules. Much of learning involves tuning of these
              subsymbolic processes. A number of simple and complex empirical
              examples are described to illustrate how these modules function

              apprehension) of a future event that could not otherwise be
              anticipated through any known inferential process. Precognition
              and premonition are themselves special cases of a more general
              phenomenon: the anomalous retroactive influence of some future
              event on an individual's current responses, whether those
              responses are conscious or nonconscious, cognitive or affective.
              This article reports 9 experiments, involving more than 1,000
              participants, that test for retroactive influence by ``time-
              reversing'' well-established psychological effects so that the
              individual's responses are obtained before the putatively causal
              stimulus events occur. Data are presented for 4 time-reversed
              effects: precognitive approach to erotic stimuli and precognitive
              avoidance of negative stimuli; retroactive priming; retroactive
              habituation; and retroactive facilitation of recall. All but one

              midpoint on a scale of stimulus seeking achieving a mean effect
              size of 0.43. Skepticism about psi, issues of replication, and

              rather not answer by answering a different question? In 4 studies,
              we show that listeners can fail to detect dodges when speakers
              answer similar-but objectively incorrect-questions (the ``artful
              dodge''), a detection failure that goes hand-in-hand with a
              failure to rate dodgers more negatively. We propose that dodges go
              undetected because listeners' attention is not usually directed
              toward a goal of dodge detection (i.e., Is this person answering
              the question?) but rather toward a goal of social evaluation
              (i.e., Do I like this person?). Listeners were not blind to all
              dodge attempts, however. Dodge detection increased when listeners'
              attention was diverted from social goals toward determining the
              relevance of the speaker's answers (Study 1), when speakers
              answered a question egregiously dissimilar to the one asked (Study
              2), and when listeners' attention was directed to the question
              asked by keeping it visible during speakers' answers (Study 4). We
              also examined the interpersonal consequences of dodge attempts:
              When listeners were guided to detect dodges, they rated speakers
              more negatively (Study 2), and listeners rated speakers who
              answered a similar question in a fluent manner more positively
              than speakers who answered the actual question but disfluently
              (Study 3). These results add to the literatures on both Gricean

                 forming impressions of others? Recent research in social
                 cognition suggests that ``warmth,'' broadly construed, should
                 be of prime importance in impression formation. Yet, some prior
                 research suggests that information about others' specifically
                 moral traits--their moral ``character''--may be a primary
                 dimension. Although warmth and character have sometimes been
                 conceived of as interchangeable, we argue that they are
                 separable, and that across a wide variety of contexts,
                 character is usually more important than warmth in impression
                 formation. We first showed that moral character and social
                 warmth traits are indeed separable (Studies 1 and 2). Further
                 studies that used correlational and experimental methods showed
                 that, as predicted, in most contexts, moral character
                 information is more important in impression formation than is
                 warmth information (Studies 2-6). Character information was
                 also more important than warmth information with respect to
                 judgments of traits' perceived fundamentalness to identity,
                 their uniquely human quality, their context-independence, and
                 their controllability (Study 2). Finally, Study 7 used an
                 archival method to show that moral character information
                 appears more prominently than warmth information in obituaries,
                 and more strongly determines the impressions people form of the
                 individuals described in those obituaries. We discuss
                 implications for current theories of person perception and

                 negative emotions 4 times per day for 7 days (1,579
                 observations). We examined language using the Linguistic
                 Inquiry and Word Count program (LIWC; theoretically created
                 dictionaries) and open-vocabulary themes (clusters of
                 data-driven semantically-related words). Although some studies
                 give the impression that LIWC's positive and negative emotion

                 substantive everyday correlates of momentary positive and
                 negative emotion that can be tested in future studies. These

                 self-diagnostic symptom checkers has substantially increased in

                 manually compiled through a labor-intensive process or
                 automatically derived using simple pairwise statistics. This
                 study explored an automated process to learn high quality
                 knowledge bases linking diseases and symptoms directly from
                 electronic medical records. Medical concepts were extracted
                 from 273,174 de-identified patient records and maximum
                 likelihood estimation of three probabilistic models was used to
                 automatically construct knowledge graphs: logistic regression,
                 naive Bayes classifier and a Bayesian network using noisy OR
                 gates. A graph of disease-symptom relationships was elicited
                 from the learned parameters and the constructed knowledge
                 graphs were evaluated and validated, with permission, against
                 Google's manually-constructed knowledge graph and against
                 expert physician opinions. Our study shows that direct and
                 automated construction of high quality health knowledge graphs
                 from medical records using rudimentary concept extraction is
                 feasible. The noisy OR model produces a high quality knowledge
                 graph reaching precision of 0.85 for a recall of 0.6 in the
                 clinical evaluation. Noisy OR significantly outperforms all

                 qualities could break these overall trends. Speakers on the
                 left innovated at higher rates, while speakers on the right

                 information-processing dynamics that have hitherto been

                 toward the adoption of new patterns, but speakers' individual
                 qualities could break these overall trends. Speakers on the
                 left innovated at higher rates, while speakers on the right
                 acted to preserve prior patterns. Key players such as
                 Robespierre (on the left) and Abb\'{e} Maury (on the right)
                 played information-processing roles emblematic of their
                 politics. Newly created organizational functions-such as the
                 Assembly president and committee chairs-had significant effects
                 on debate outcomes, and a distinct transition appears midway
                 through the parliament when committees, external to the debate
                 process, gained new powers to ``propose and dispose.'' Taken
                 together, these quantitative results align with existing
                 qualitative interpretations, but also reveal crucial
                 information-processing dynamics that have hitherto been
                 overlooked. Great orators had the public's attention, but
                 deputies (mostly on the political left) who mastered the
                 committee system gained new powers to shape revolutionary
                 legislation.",

                 represents each English word by a vector. The geometric
                 relationship between these vectors captures meaningful semantic
                 relationships between the corresponding words. In this paper,
                 we develop a framework to demonstrate how the temporal dynamics
                 of the embedding helps to quantify changes in stereotypes and
                 attitudes toward women and ethnic minorities in the 20th and
                 21st centuries in the United States. We integrate word
                 embeddings trained on 100 y of text data with the US Census to
                 show that changes in the embedding track closely with
                 demographic and occupation shifts over time. The embedding
                 captures societal shifts-e.g., the women's movement in the
                 1960s and Asian immigration into the United States-and also
                 illuminates how specific adjectives and occupations became more
                 closely associated with certain populations over time. Our
                 framework for temporal analysis of word embedding opens up a

                 for informing, entertaining, and making sense of the world. But
                 while everyday language often describes discourse as moving
                 quickly or slowly, covering a lot of ground, or going in

                 examined whether they are beneficial. To fill this gap, we use
                 several state-of-the-art natural language-processing and
                 machine-learning techniques to represent texts as sequences of

              popular television programmes such as Rescue 911. Rather than play
              into media presentations of them as silent heroes ``just doin' our
              job,'' paramedics tend to present themselves in their stories as
              anti-heroes, always ready with a sardonic quip in even the most
              horrific situations. This storytelling is part of the medics'
              tactical resistance to the various groups with whom they come into
              contact on a daily basis, including managers, field supervisors,
              hospital personnel, firefighters, police officers, bystanders,
              their patients and each other. In the course of their
              storytelling, medics often resort to strong language. For the sake
              of authenticity, this has been retained in the transcripts in this

              (Landauer and Dumais, 1997). The underlying idea is that the

              determines the similarity of meaning of words and sets of words to

               Synthesis of evidence from a wide variety of sources suggests
               four distinct types of knowledge reuse situations according to
               the knowledge reuser and the purpose of knowledge reuse. The
               types involve shared work producers, who produce knowledge they
               later reuse; shared work practitioners, who reuse each other's
               knowledge contributions; expertise-seeking novices; and secondary
               knowledge miners. Each type of knowledge reuser has different

               repositories are created, reusers'requirements often remain

                 U.S. births. We assert that doulas are rarely used, in part,
                 because it is difficult to situate them within the contemporary
                 U.S. master birth narrative that places family and medical
                 staff as expected characters in the birth story. This
                 qualitative study uses narrative theorizing to describe the
                 communicatively situated position of doulas in light of the
                 dominant U.S. master birth narrative. Through an analysis of
                 interviews and focus groups with mothers, expectant parents,
                 doulas, and medical staff (n = 52) at a community hospital, we
                 explain how individuals communicatively located the doula as a
                 character who occupied a liminal space that is (a) between
                 borders, (b) crossing borders, and (c) outside borders.
                 Although doulas' liminal location enables individuals to
                 creatively explain and promote doulas to important publics,
                 doulas' conceptual ambiguity in the birth narrative can also be

               modeling of text. Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling from
               the posterior distribution is typically performed using a

               state-of-the-art samplers for topic models on five well-known
               text corpora of differing sizes and properties. In particular, we
               propose and compare two different strategies for sampling the
               parameter block with latent topic indicators. The experiments
               show that the increase in statistical inefficiency from only
               partial collapsing is smaller than commonly assumed, and can be
               more than compensated by the speedup from parallelization and
               sparsity on larger corpora. We also prove that the partially
               collapsed samplers scale well with the size of the corpus. The
               proposed algorithm is fast, efficient, exact, and can be used in
               more modeling situations than the ordinary collapsed sampler.

              and reproductive activities and functions. After a review of the

               of color in Xbox Live, an online gaming community. Ethnographic
               observations and narrative interviewing reveal that women of
               color, as outsiders failing to conform to the white male norm,
               face intersecting oppressions in main stream gaming. They are
               linguistically profiled within the space based on how they sound.
               Specifically, Latina women within the space experience nativism,
               racism, sexism, and even heterosexism as many identify as sexual
               minorities. African-American women experience racialized sexism
               stemming from the duality of their ascribed identities. The women
               within the study have responded by segregating from the larger
               gaming community and have created their own clans (similar to
               guilds) and game with other women. The purpose of the clans
               depends on the type of oppressions experienced by the women

               of nearly 700,000 users? News Feeds to induce changes in their
               emotions. This experiment was widely criticized on ethical
               grounds regarding informed consent. This controversy, however,
               diverted attention from a more important concern the experiment
               was intended to address, which is the impact of Facebook use on
               well-being. In this paper, I explore the well-being concerns
               raised by prior research and argue that the experiment does not
               alleviate them, owing to poor research design. As the question of
               Facebook's impact on well-being is of great importance, both to
               Facebook and to society overall, there is a pressing need for
               more experimental research that is both sensitive to informed
               consent and carefully designed to yield reliable results. In
               turn, the lessons of this case have implications for general

               justice, as they speak directly to the threat that ?big data? and
               algorithmic decision-making may worsen already existing
               injustices. In the United States, grappling with these problems
               has found clearest expression through liberal discourses of
               rights, due process, and antidiscrimination. Work in this area,
               however, has tended to overlook certain established limits of
               antidiscrimination discourses for bringing about the change
               demanded by social justice. In this paper, I engage three of
               these limits: 1) an overemphasis on discrete ?bad actors?, 2)
               single-axis thinking that centers disadvantage, and 3) an
               inordinate focus on a limited set of goods. I show that, in
               mirroring some of antidiscrimination discourse?s most problematic
               tendencies, efforts to achieve fairness and combat algorithmic
               discrimination fail to address the very hierarchical logic that
               produces advantaged and disadvantaged subjects in the first
               place. Finally, I conclude by sketching three paths for future
               work to better account for the structural conditions against
               which we come to understand problems of data and unjust
               discrimination in the first place.",

               on work in the cultural industries. Online games are services
               that are networked, operate around the clock and require ongoing
               player and company input. The industry's content production
               networks are dispersed internationally, and many of its services
               are offered transnationally. These new services have generated
               new forms of work, like community management, which are often
               outsourced to near-to-market locations. Much of the research on
               media work is focused on high status creative occupations or the
               free labour of amateurs. This paper draws upon the findings of a
               content analysis of job advertisements and face-to-face
               interviews with community managers to examine the recruitment and
               work of community managers. Using scholarship on media
               production, media work and emotional labour this article argues
               that recruitment and organizational practices surrounding
               community managers appropriate passion, community, and experience
               in the service of capital, but also marginalize these workers.
               While community managers see themselves as creative workers,
               their visibility and creative autonomy are limited by
               organizational and workplace cultures.",

                 on the experimental findings -- of two computational models
                 designed to simulate the dynamic systems and behavioural
                 patterns identified and clarified by research on terror
                 management theory. The causal architectures of these models are
                 informed by empirical research on the effects of mortality
                 salience on ``religiosity'' (and vice versa). They are also
                 informed by research on the way in which perception of personal
                 and environmental hazards activate evolved cognitive and
                 coalitional precautionary systems that can intensify
                 anxiety-alleviating behaviours such as imaginative engagement
                 with supernatural agents postulated within a religious
                 coalition. The capacity of the models to produce emergent
                 patterns and behaviours that are similar to the results of
                 other empirical studies supports the plausibility of their
                 causal architectures. After tracing some of the literature that
                 supports the causal dynamics of our models, we present the two
                 models, describe the experiments, and report the results. We
                 conclude by discussing the importance of the findings, the

                 in face-to-face interactions but only to a limited degree in

                 numbers from six Internet forums (three discussion and three
                 support groups), and written in equal numbers by each gender,
                 and 240 first responses to them (a total of 480 forum
                 messages). Trained, expert judges blindly rated each message on
                 the degree to which it disclosed personal information,
                 thoughts, and feelings. Linguistic parameters (total number of
                 words and number of first-voice words) were also used as
                 dependent variables. Results showed the following: (a)
                 self-disclosure in support forums was much higher than in
                 discussion forums, in terms of both total number and type of
                 disclosure; (b) messages in support forums were longer and
                 included more first-voice words than in discussion forums; (c)
                 there were no gender differences interacting with level of
                 self-disclosure; (d) reciprocity of self-disclosure was
                 evident, yielding positive correlations between the measures of
                 self-disclosure in messages and responses to them; (e) some
                 differences appeared in level of reciprocity of self-disclosure
                 between male and female participants, with female respondents
                 tending to be more reciprocal than male respondents. The
                 implications of these results are discussed in light of growing

                 significant links between these populations and online video

                 evaluating the link between gaming-related friendships and
                 shyness, as quantified by emotional sensitivity. Drawing from a
                 representative sample of German game players, the results

                 opinions and where they reveal themselves to their peers. We
                 analyze a sample of 123,000 Twitter users and 25 million of
                 their tweets to investigate the relation between the opinions
                 and emotions that users express and their predicted
                 psychodemographic traits. We show that the emotions that we
                 express on online social networks reveal deep insights about
                 ourselves. Our methodology is based on building machine
                 learning models for inferring coarse-grained emotions and
                 psychodemographic profiles from user-generated content. We
                 examine several user attributes, including gender, income,
                 political views, age, education, optimism, and life
                 satisfaction. We correlate these predicted demographics with
                 the emotional profiles emanating from user tweets, as captured
                 by Ekman's emotion classification. We find that some users tend
                 to express significantly more joy and significantly less
                 sadness in their tweets, such as those predicted to be in a
                 relationship, with children, or with a higher than average
                 annual income or educational level. Users predicted to be women
                 tend to be more opinionated, whereas those predicted to be men
                 tend to be more neutral. Finally, users predicted to be younger
                 and liberal tend to project more negative opinions and
                 emotions. We discuss the implications of our findings to online

                 treatment by modality, and treatment barriers by pregnancy
                 status among U.S. reproductive-aged women. METHODS: We
                 identified 375 pregnant and 8,657 nonpregnant women 18-44 years
                 of age who met criteria for past-year major depressive episode
                 (MDE) from 2005-2009 nationally representative data. Chi-square
                 statistics and adjusted prevalence ratios (aPR) were

                 undiagnosed more often than in nonpregnant women (58.6\%) (aPR
                 1.1, 95\% confidence interval [CI] 1.0-1.3). Half of depressed
                 pregnant (49.6\%) and nonpregnant (53.7\%) women received

                 medication the most common form for both pregnant (39.6\%) and

                 treatment (41.7\%), and stigma (26.3\%). CONCLUSIONS: Pregnant

               senators from 2007, which I demonstrate is an ideal medium to
               measure how senators explain their work in Washington to
               constituents. A set of examples validates the estimated
               priorities and demonstrates their usefulness for testing theories

               have hindered their use in political science research. Here lies
               the promise of automated text analysis: it substantially reduces
               the costs of analyzing large collections of text. We provide a

               instances, the methods have already obtained part of their
               promise. But there are pitfalls to using automated methods--they
               are no substitute for careful thought and close reading and
               require extensive and problem-specific validation. We survey a
               wide range of new methods, provide guidance on how to validate
               the output of the models, and clarify misconceptions and errors
               in the literature. To conclude, we argue that for automated text
               methods to become a standard tool for political scientists,

                 pregnancy-related mortality estimates and examine
                 characteristics and causes of pregnancy-related deaths in the
                 United States during 2006-2010. METHODS: We used data from the
                 Pregnancy Mortality Surveillance System and calculated
                 pregnancy-related mortality ratios by year and age group for
                 four race-ethnicity groups: non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic
                 black, Hispanic, and other. We examined causes of
                 pregnancy-related deaths by pregnancy outcome during 2006-2010
                 and compared causes of pregnancy-related deaths since 1987.
                 RESULTS: The 2006-2010 pregnancy-related mortality ratio was
                 16.0 deaths per 100,000 live births (20,959,533 total live
                 births). Specific race-ethnicity pregnancy-related mortality
                 ratios were 12.0, 38.9, 11.7, and 14.2 deaths per 100,000 live
                 births for non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, Hispanic,
                 and other race women, respectively. Pregnancy-related mortality
                 ratios increased with maternal age for all women and within all
                 age groups, non-Hispanic black women had the highest risk of
                 dying from pregnancy complications. Over time, the contribution
                 to pregnancy-related deaths of hemorrhage, hypertensive
                 disorders of pregnancy, embolism, and anesthesia complications
                 continued to decline, whereas the contribution of
                 cardiovascular conditions and infection increased. Seven of 10
                 categories of causes of death each contributed from 9.4\% to
                 14.6\% of all 2006-2010 pregnancy-related deaths;
                 cardiovascular conditions ranked first. CONCLUSION: Relative to
                 previous years, during 2006-2010, the U.S. pregnancy-related
                 mortality ratio increased as did the contribution of
                 cardiovascular conditions and infection to pregnancy-related
                 mortality. Although the identification of pregnancy-related
                 deaths may be improving in the United States, the increasing
                 contribution of chronic diseases to pregnancy-related mortality
                 suggests a change in risk profile of the birthing population.

                 in pregnancy question formats over time and between states, and
                 to provide an overview of U.S. maternal mortality trends from

                 statistics maternal mortality data from all U.S. states in
                 relation to the format and year of adoption of the pregnancy
                 question. Correction factors were developed to adjust data from
                 before the standard pregnancy question was adopted to promote
                 accurate trend analysis. Joinpoint regression was used to
                 analyze trends for groups of states with similar pregnancy
                 questions. RESULTS: The estimated maternal mortality rate (per
                 100,000 live births) for 48 states and Washington, DC
                 (excluding California and Texas, analyzed separately) increased
                 by 26.6\%, from 18.8 in 2000 to 23.8 in 2014. California showed
                 a declining trend, whereas Texas had a sudden increase in
                 2011-2012. Analysis of the measurement change suggests that
                 U.S. rates in the early 2000s were higher than previously
                 reported. CONCLUSION: Despite the United Nations Millennium
                 Development Goal for a 75\% reduction in maternal mortality by
                 2015, the estimated maternal mortality rate for 48 states and
                 Washington, DC, increased from 2000 to 2014; the international
                 trend was in the opposite direction. There is a need to
                 redouble efforts to prevent maternal deaths and improve
                 maternity care for the 4 million U.S. women giving birth each

                 METHODS: De-identified copies of death certificates for women
                 who died during or within 1 year of pregnancy and matching
                 birth or fetal death certificates for 1998 through 2005 were
                 received by the Pregnancy Mortality Surveillance System from
                 the 50 states, New York City, and Washington, DC. Causes of
                 death and factors associated with them were identified, and
                 pregnancy-related mortality ratios (pregnancy-related deaths
                 per 100,000 live births) were calculated. RESULTS: The
                 aggregate pregnancy-related mortality ratio for the 8-year
                 period was 14.5 per 100,000 live births, which is higher than
                 any period in the previous 20 years of the Pregnancy Mortality
                 Surveillance System. African-American women continued to have a
                 three- to four-fold higher risk of pregnancy-related death. The
                 proportion of deaths attributable to hemorrhage and
                 hypertensive disorders declined from previous years, whereas
                 the proportion from medical conditions, particularly
                 cardiovascular, increased. Seven causes of death--hemorrhage,
                 thrombotic pulmonary embolism, infection, hypertensive
                 disorders of pregnancy, cardiomyopathy, cardiovascular
                 conditions, and noncardiovascular medical conditions--each
                 contributed 10\% to 13\% of deaths. CONCLUSION: The reasons for
                 the reported increase in pregnancy-related mortality are
                 unclear; possible factors include an increase in the risk of
                 women dying, changed coding with the International
                 Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, and the addition by
                 states of pregnancy checkboxes to the death certificate.

  abstract    = "In modern societies, cultural change seems ceaseless. The flux
                 of fashion is especially obvious for popular music. While much
                 has been written about the origin and evolution of pop, most
                 claims about its history are anecdotal rather than scientific
                 in nature. To rectify this, we investigate the US Billboard Hot
                 100 between 1960 and 2010. Using music information retrieval
                 and text-mining tools, we analyse the musical properties of
                 approximately 17 000 recordings that appeared in the charts and
                 demonstrate quantitative trends in their harmonic and timbral
                 properties. We then use these properties to produce an
                 audio-based classification of musical styles and study the
                 evolution of musical diversity and disparity, testing, and
                 rejecting, several classical theories of cultural change.
                 Finally, we investigate whether pop musical evolution has been
                 gradual or punctuated. We show that, although pop music has
                 evolved continuously, it did so with particular rapidity during
                 three stylistic 'revolutions' around 1964, 1983 and 1991. We
                 conclude by discussing how our study points the way to a
                 quantitative science of cultural change.",

                 capacity for the evolution of language, the multiplicity of
                 definitions being used has undermined the broader
                 interpretation of empirical results. I propose that only a
                 definition focused on representational abilities allows the
                 prediction of specific behavioural traits that enable us to
                 distinguish recursion from non-recursive iteration and from
                 hierarchical embedding: only subjects able to represent
                 recursion, i.e. to represent different hierarchical
                 dependencies (related by parenthood) with the same set of
                 rules, are able to generalize and produce new levels of
                 embedding beyond those specified a priori (in the algorithm or
                 in the input). The ability to use such representations may be
                 advantageous in several domains: action sequencing,
                 problem-solving, spatial navigation, social navigation and for
                 the emergence of conventionalized communication systems. The
                 ability to represent contiguous hierarchical levels with the
                 same rules may lead subjects to expect unknown levels and
                 constituents to behave similarly, and this prior knowledge may
                 bias learning positively. Finally, a new paradigm to test for
                 recursion is presented. Preliminary results suggest that the
                 ability to represent recursion in the spatial domain recruits
                 both visual and verbal resources. Implications regarding

              Amazon and Goodreads, and covering six literary fiction genres.
              The authors rely on stylometric analysis to explore the linguistic
              properties and lexicon of reviews and the authors conducted
              automatic classification experiments using multiple approaches and
              feature configurations to predict either the review's platform or
              the literary genre.Findings The analysis of user-generated reviews
              demonstrates that language is a quite variable dimension across
              reading platforms, but not as much across book genres. The
              classification experiments revealed that features modelling the
              syntactic structure of the sentence are reliable proxies for
              discerning Amazon and Goodreads reviews, whereas lexical

              different people, thus the emphasis and wording
              vary\nconsiderably.\nWe test four automatic methods of anomaly
              detection in text that are\npopular in the current literature on
              text mining. The first method that\nwe describe is k-means or
              Gaussian mixture model and its application to\nthe term-document
              matrix. The second method is the Sammon nonlinear map,\nwhich
              projects high dimensional document vectors into two dimensions
              for\nvisualization and clustering purposes. The third method is
              based on an\nanalysis of the results of applying a new clustering
              method, Expectation\nMaximization on a mixture of von Mises Fisher
              distributions, that\nrepresents each document as a point on a high
              dimensional sphere. In\nthis space, we perform clustering to
              obtain sets of similar documents.\nThe results are derived from a
              new method known as spectral clustering,\nwhere vectors from the
              term-document matrix are embedded in a high\ndimensional space for
              clustering.\nThe paper concludes with recommendations regarding
              the development of an\noperational text mining system for analysis
              of problem reports that\narise from complex space systems. We also
              contrast such systems with\ngeneral purpose text mining systems,
              illustrating the areas in which\nthis system needs to be specified
              for the space domain.",

  abstract  = "Recently, there has been an explosion of cloud-based services
               that enable developers to include a spectrum of recognition
               services, such as emotion recognition, in their applications. The
               recognition of emotions is a challenging problem, and research
               has been done on building classifiers to recognize emotion in the
               open world. Often, learned emotion models are trained on data
               sets that may not sufficiently represent a target population of
               interest. For example, many of these on-line services have
               focused on training and testing using a majority representation
               of adults and thus are tuned to the dynamics of mature faces. For
               applications designed to serve an older or younger age
               demographic, using the outputs from these pre-defined models may
               result in lower performance rates than when using a specialized
               classifier. Similar challenges with biases in performance arise
               in other situations where datasets in these large-scale on-line
               services have a non-representative ratio of the desired class of
               interest. We consider the challenge of providing application
               developers with the power to utilize pre-constructed cloud-based
               services in their applications while still ensuring satisfactory
               performance for their unique workload of cases. We focus on
               biases in emotion recognition as a representative scenario to
               evaluate an approach to improving recognition rates when an
               on-line pre-trained classifier is used for recognition of a class
               that may have a minority representation in the training set. We
               discuss a hierarchical classification approach to address this
               challenge and show that the average recognition rate associated
               with the most difficult emotion for the minority class increases
               by 41.5\% and the overall recognition rate for all classes
               increases by 17.3\% when using this approach.",

              builds a classifier in two steps. Each existing technique uses a
              different method for each step. We first introduce some new
              methods for the two steps, and perform a comprehensive evaluation
              of all possible combinations of methods of the two steps. We then
              propose a more principled approach to solving the problem based on

  abstract = "The problem of graph classification has drawn much attention in
              the last decade. Conventional approaches on graph classification
              focus on mining discriminative sub graph features under supervised
              settings. The feature selection strategies strictly follow the
              assumption that both positive and negative graphs exist. However,
              in many real-world applications, the negative graph examples are
              not available. In this paper we study the problem of how to select
              useful sub graph features and perform graph classification based
              upon only positive and unlabeled graphs. This problem is
              challenging and different from previous works on PU learning,
              because there are no predefined features in graph data. Moreover,
              the sub graph enumeration problem is NP-hard. We need to identify
              a subset of unlabeled graphs that are most likely to be negative
              graphs. However, the negative graph selection problem and the sub
              graph feature selection problem are correlated. Before the
              reliable negative graphs can be resolved, we need to have a set of
              useful sub graph features. In order to address this problem, we
              first derive an evaluation criterion to estimate the dependency
              between sub graph features and class labels based on a set of
              estimated negative graphs. In order to build accurate models for
              the PU learning problem on graph data, we propose an integrated
              approach to concurrently select the discriminative features and
              the negative graphs in an iterative manner. Experimental results
              illustrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed
              method.",

               extraction of patient-reported personal health experience from
               the forums has many important applications. For example, medical
               researchers can discover trustable knowledge from the extracted
               experience. Patients can search for peers with similar experience
               and connect with them. In this paper, we model the extraction of

               sentence in a forum post as containing patient experience or not
               containing patient experience. We propose to exploit the sentence
               context information for such experience extraction task, and
               classify the context information into global context and local
               context. A unified Context-Aware Experience Extraction (CARE)
               framework is proposed to incorporate these two types of context

              different summarizers are used for different segment types. For
              monologue segments, we adopt the integer linear programming-based

              of our proposed method is evaluated using the standard AMI meeting

              are only interested in classifying one specific land-cover type,
              without considering other classes. These situations are referred
              to as one-class classification. Traditional supervised learning is
              inefficient for one-class classification because it requires all
              classes that occur in the image to be exhaustively assigned
              labels. In this paper, we investigate a new positive and unlabeled
              learning (PUL) algorithm, applying it to one-class classifications
              of two scenes of a high-spatial-resolution aerial photograph. The
              PUL algorithm trains a classifier on positive and unlabeled data,
              estimates the probability that a positive training sample has been
              labeled, and generates binary predictions for test samples using
              an adjusted threshold. Experimental results indicate that the new
              algorithm provides high classification accuracy, outperforming the
              biased support-vector machine (SVM), one-class SVM, and Gaussian
              domain descriptor methods. The advantages of the new algorithm are
              that it can use unlabeled data to help build classifiers, and it
              requires only a small set of positive data to be labeled by hand.
              Therefore, it can significantly reduce the effort of assigning
              labels to training data without losing predictive accuracy.",

              analyzed, and aggregated from text, has seen a lot of attention in
              the last few years. The corresponding growth of the field has
              resulted in the emergence of various subareas, each addressing a
              different level of analysis or research question. This survey
              focuses on aspect-level sentiment analysis, where the goal is to
              find and aggregate sentiment on entities mentioned within
              documents or aspects of them. An in-depth overview of the current
              state-of-the-art is given, showing the tremendous progress that
              has already been made in finding both the target, which can be an
              entity as such, or some aspect of it, and the corresponding
              sentiment. Aspect-level sentiment analysis yields very
              fine-grained sentiment information which can be useful for
              applications in various domains. Current solutions are categorized
              based on whether they provide a method for aspect detection,
              sentiment analysis, or both. Furthermore, a breakdown based on the
              type of algorithm used is provided. For each discussed study, the

              evaluation of the various proposed methods, a call is made for the

              use of shared data sets. Semanticallyrich concept-centric

              hundreds or thousands of training examples. We show that it is
              possible to learn much information about a category from just one,
              or a handful, of images. The key insight is that, rather than
              learning from scratch, one can take advantage of knowledge coming
              from previously learned categories, no matter how different these
              categories might be. We explore a Bayesian implementation of this
              idea. Object categories are represented by probabilistic models.
              Prior knowledge is represented as a probability density function
              on the parameters of these models. The posterior model for an
              object category is obtained by updating the prior in the light of
              one or more observations. We test a simple implementation of our
              algorithm on a database of 101 diverse object categories. We
              compare category models learned by an implementation of our
              Bayesian approach to models learned from by Maximum Likelihood
              (ML) and Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) methods. We find that on a
              database of more than 100 categories, the Bayesian approach
              produces informative models when the number of training examples
              is too small for other methods to operate successfully.",

                 women's experiences of giving birth) is a common and important
                 social practice. Whereas most research on birth narratives
                 reflects the stories of middle-class, 'adult' women, we examine
                 how the birth stories told by early-age mothers interconnect
                 with broader narratives regarding social stigma and
                 childbearing at 'too early' an age. Drawing on narrative
                 theory, we analyse in-depth interviews with 81 mothers (ages
                 15-24 years) conducted in Greater Vancouver and Prince George,
                 Canada, in 2014-15. Their accounts of giving birth reveal the
                 central importance of birth narratives in their identity
                 formation as young mothers. Participants' narratives
                 illuminated the complex interactions among identity formation,
                 social expectations, and negotiations of social and physical
                 spaces as they narrated their experiences of labour and birth.
                 Through the use of narrative inquiry, we examine the ways in
                 which re-telling the experience of giving birth serves to
                 situate young mothers in relation to their past and future
                 selves. These personal stories are also told in relation to a
                 meta-narrative regarding social stigma faced by 'teenage'

                 national data reflect a consistent relationship between EHR
                 adoption and hospital outcomes across three important
                 dimensions of hospital performance. DATA SOURCES/STUDY SETTING:
                 Secondary data from the American Hospital Association and CMS
                 (Hospital Compare and EHR Incentive Programs) for nonfederal,
                 acute-care hospitals (2009-2012). STUDY DESIGN: We examined the
                 relationship between EHR adoption and three hospital outcomes
                 (process adherence, patient satisfaction, efficiency) using
                 ordinary least squares models with hospital fixed effects.
                 Time-related effects were assessed through comparing the impact
                 of EHR adoption pre (2008/2009) versus post (2010/2011)
                 meaningful use and by meaningful use attestation cohort (2011,
                 2012, 2013, Never). We used a continuous measure of hospital
                 EHR adoption based on the proportion of electronic functions
                 implemented. DATA COLLECTION/EXTRACTION METHODS: We created a
                 panel dataset with hospital-year observations. PRINCIPAL
                 FINDINGS: Higher levels of EHR adoption were associated with
                 better performance on process adherence (0.147; p < .001) and
                 patient satisfaction (0.118; p < .001), but not efficiency
                 (0.01; p = .78). For all three outcomes, there was a stronger,
                 positive relationship between EHR adoption and performance in
                 2010/2011 compared to 2008/2009. We found mixed results based
                 on meaningful use attestation cohort. CONCLUSIONS: Performance
                 gains associated with EHR adoption are apparent in more recent
                 years. The large national investment in EHRs appears to be
                 delivering more consistent benefits than indicated by earlier

              argument that greater attention should be paid to understanding
              the role that employee attitudes, attributes and behaviours play.
              Emerging research suggests that trust and well-being are two
              aspects that could contribute to this debate. Research has shown
              some relationships between trust and well-being. However, this has
              tended to omit consideration of an individual's propensity to
              trust due to lack of suitable measures. This paper explores the
              relationships between propensity to trust and well-being by means
              of a study of 458 managers using a newly developed instrument to
              assess propensity and established well-being scales. Analyses of
              the results demonstrated a reliable measure of propensity and a
              range of positive relationships. The potential implications for HR
              policies and practices of a measure of propensity are discussed.
              In particular application in the areas of selection and

              automated text analysis involves selecting keywords to choose
              documents from a large text corpus for further study. Although all
              substantive results depend on this choice, researchers usually
              pick keywords in ad hoc ways that are far from optimal and usually
              biased. Most seem to think that keyword selection is easy, since
              they do Google searches every day, but we demonstrate that humans
              perform exceedingly poorly at this basic task. We offer a better
              approach, one that also can help with following conversations
              where participants rapidly innovate language to evade authorities,
              seek political advantage, or express creativity; generic web
              searching; eDiscovery; look-alike modeling; industry and
              intelligence analysis; and sentiment and topic analysis. We
              develop a computer-assisted (as opposed to fully automated or
              human-only) statistical approach that suggests keywords from
              available text without needing structured data as inputs. This
              framing poses the statistical problem in a new way, which leads to
              a widely applicable algorithm. Our specific approach is based on
              training classifiers, extracting information from (rather than
              correcting) their mistakes, and summarizing results with
              easy-to-understand Boolean search strings. We illustrate how the

                 paper, we introduce a large dataset of human judgments about
                 novel adjective-noun phrases. We use these data to test an
                 approach to semantic deviance based on phrase representations
                 derived with compositional distributional semantic methods,
                 that is, methods that derive word meanings from contextual
                 information, and approximate phrase meanings by combining word
                 meanings. We present several simple measures extracted from
                 distributional representations of words and phrases, and we
                 show that they have a significant impact on predicting the
                 acceptability of novel adjective-noun phrases even when a
                 number of alternative measures classically employed in studies

                 of the noun is the most significant factor in modeling the
                 distinction between acceptable and deviant phrases. Our study
                 extends current applications of compositional distributional

                 records (EHR) has contributed to physicians and nurses
                 experiencing information overload. To address the problem of
                 information overload, an assessment of the information needs of
                 physicians and nurses will assist in understanding what they
                 view as useful information to make patient care more efficient.
                 OBJECTIVE: To analyse studies that assessed the information
                 needs and information-seeking behaviour of physicians and
                 nurses in a primary care setting to develop a better
                 understanding of what information to present to physicians when
                 they making clinical decisions. METHOD: A literature review of
                 studies was conducted with a comprehensive search in PubMed,
                 cinahl, scopus, as well as examination of references from
                 relevant papers and hand-searched articles to identify articles
                 applicable to this review. RESULTS: Of the papers reviewed the
                 most common information needs found among physicians and nurses
                 were related to diagnoses, drug(s) and treatment/therapy.
                 Colleagues remain a preferred information source among
                 physicians and nurses; however, a rise in Internet usage is
                 apparent. CONCLUSION: Physicians and nurses need access to the
                 Internet and job-specific resources to find
                 practitioner-oriented information. In addition, effective usage
                 of resources is important for improving patient care.",

               through the text, resulting in a gradually emerging

              effect size predictions that are compared to the effect size
              estimates and related confidence intervals to test the theoretical
              predictions. This procedure is illustrated employing the
              Transtheoretical Model. Data from a sample (N = 3,967) of smokers
              from a large New England HMO system were used to test the model.

                 providing new opportunities and increasing challenges for
                 health care practitioners and users. With pregnant women
                 reportedly turning to the Internet for information during
                 pregnancy, a better understanding of this behavior is needed.
                 The objective of this study was to ascertain why and how
                 pregnant women use the Internet as a health information source,
                 and the overall effect it had on their decision making.
                 Kuhlthau's (1993) information-seeking model was adapted to
                 provide the underpinning theoretical framework for the study.
                 METHODS: The design was exploratory and descriptive. Data were
                 collected using a valid and reliable web-based questionnaire.
                 Over a 12-week period, 613 women from 24 countries who had
                 confirmed that they had used the Internet for pregnancy-related
                 information during their pregnancy completed and submitted a
                 questionnaire. RESULTS: Most women (97\%) used search engines
                 such as Google to identify online web pages to access a large
                 variety of pregnancy-related information and to use the
                 Internet for pregnancy-related social networking, support, and
                 electronic commerce (i.e., e-commerce). Almost 94 percent of
                 women used the Internet to supplement information already
                 provided by health professionals and 83 percent used it to
                 influence their pregnancy decision making. Nearly half of the
                 respondents reported dissatisfaction with information given by
                 health professionals (48.6\%) and lack of time to ask health
                 professionals questions (46.5\%) as key factors influencing
                 them to access the Internet. Statistically, women's confidence
                 levels significantly increased with respect to making decisions
                 about their pregnancy after Internet usage (p < 0.05).
                 CONCLUSIONS: In this study, the Internet played a significant
                 part in the respondents' health information seeking and
                 decision making in pregnancy. Health professionals need to be
                 ready to support pregnant women in online data retrieval,
                 interpretation, and application.",

                 popular in cognitive science. The appeal of these models lies
                 in their ability to represent meaning simply by using
                 distributional information under the assumption that words
                 occurring within similar contexts are semantically similar.
                 Despite their widespread use, vector-based models are typically
                 directed at representing words in isolation, and methods for
                 constructing representations for phrases or sentences have
                 received little attention in the literature. This is in marked
                 contrast to experimental evidence (e.g., in sentential priming)
                 suggesting that semantic similarity is more complex than simply
                 a relation between isolated words. This article proposes a
                 framework for representing the meaning of word combinations in
                 vector space. Central to our approach is vector composition,
                 which we operationalize in terms of additive and multiplicative
                 functions. Under this framework, we introduce a wide range of
                 composition models that we evaluate empirically on a phrase

                 on three measures of emergency physician (EP) productivity in
                 an adult emergency department (ED). METHODS: For this
                 retrospective study, 243 clinical shifts (of either 10 or 12
                 hours) worked by 13 EPs during an 18-month period were selected
                 for evaluation. Payroll data sheets were examined to determine
                 whether these shifts were covered, uncovered, or partially
                 covered (for less than 4 hours) by a scribe; partially covered
                 shifts were grouped with uncovered shifts for analysis. Covered
                 shifts were compared to uncovered shifts in a clustered design,
                 by physician. Hierarchical linear models were used to study the
                 association between percentage of patients with which a scribe
                 was used during a shift and EP productivity as measured by
                 patients per hour, relative value units (RVUs) per hour, and
                 turnaround time (TAT) to discharge. RESULTS: RVUs per hour
                 increased by 0.24 units (95\% confidence interval [CI] = 0.10
                 to 0.38, p = 0.0011) for every 10\% increment in scribe usage
                 during a shift. The number of patients per hour increased by
                 0.08 (95\% CI = 0.04 to 0.12, p = 0.0024) for every 10\%
                 increment of scribe usage during a shift. TAT was not
                 significantly associated with scribe use. These associations
                 did not lose significance after accounting for physician
                 assistant (PA) use. CONCLUSIONS: In this retrospective study,
                 EP use of a scribe was associated with improved overall
                 productivity as measured by patients treated per hour (Pt/hr)

                 naturally occurring, culturally constituted, communicative
                 activities. Usage affects learning and it affects languages,
                 too. These are essential components of a theory of language
                 cognition. This article summarizes these developments within
                 cognitive science before considering implications for language
                 research and teaching, especially as these concern usage-based
                 language learning and cognition in second language and
                 multilingual contexts. Here, I prioritize research involving
                 corpus-, computational-, and psycho-linguistics, and cognitive
                 psychological, complex adaptive system, and network science
                 investigations of learner?language interactions. But there are
                 many other implications. Looking at languages through any one
                 single lens does not do the phenomena justice. Taking the
                 social turn does not entail restricting our research focus to
                 the social. Nor does it obviate more traditional approaches to
                 second language acquisition. Instead it calls for greater
                 transdisciplinarity, diversity, and collaborative work.",

  abstract    = "BACKGROUND: Experiences typically considered private, such as,
                 miscarriages and preterm births are being discussed publicly on
                 social media and Internet discussion websites. These data can
                 provide timely illustrations of how individuals discuss
                 miscarriages and preterm births, as well as insights into the
                 wellbeing of women who have experienced a miscarriage. Here we
                 aim to characterise how users discuss the topic of miscarriage
                 and preterm births on Twitter, analyse trends and drivers, and
                 describe the perceived emotional state of women who have
                 experienced a miscarriage. METHODS: We obtained 291 443 Twitter
                 postings on miscarriages and preterm births from January 2017
                 through December 2018. Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) was
                 used to identify major topics of discussion. We applied time
                 series decomposition methods to assess temporal trends and
                 identify major drivers of discussion. Furthermore, four coders
                 labelled the emotional content of 7282 personal miscarriage
                 disclosure tweets into the following non-mutually exclusive
                 categories: grief/sadness/depression, anger, relief, isolation,
                 annoyance, and neutral. RESULTS: Topics in our data fell into
                 eight groups: celebrity disclosures, Michelle Obama's
                 disclosure, politics, healthcare, preterm births, loss and
                 anxiety, flu vaccine and ectopic pregnancies. Political
                 discussions around miscarriages were largely due to a
                 misunderstanding between abortions and miscarriages. Grief and
                 annoyance were the most commonly expressed emotions within the
                 miscarriage self-disclosures; 50.6\% (95\% confidence interval
                 [CI] 49.1, 52.2) and 16.2\% (95\% CI 15.2, 17.3). Postings
                 increased with celebrity disclosures, pharmacists' refusal of
                 prescribed medications and outrage over the high rate of
                 preterm births in the United States. Miscarriage disclosures by
                 celebrities also led to disclosures by women who had similar
                 experiences. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that increase in
                 discussions of miscarriage on social media are associated with
                 several factors, including celebrity disclosures. Additionally,
                 there is a misunderstanding of the potential physical,
                 emotional and psychological impacts on individuals who lose a
                 pregnancy due to a miscarriage.",

  abstract = "The dramatic growth in practical applications for machine learning
              over the last ten years has been accompanied by many important
              developments in the underlying algorithms and techniques. For
              example, Bayesian methods have grown from a specialist niche to
              become mainstream, while graphical models have emerged as a
              general framework for describing and applying probabilistic
              techniques. The practical applicability of Bayesian methods has
              been greatly enhanced by the development of a range of approximate
              inference algorithms such as variational Bayes and expectation
              propagation, while new models based on kernels have had a
              significant impact on both algorithms and applications. This
              completely new textbook reflects these recent developments while
              providing a comprehensive introduction to the fields of pattern
              recognition and machine learning. It is aimed at advanced
              undergraduates or first-year PhD students, as well as researchers
              and practitioners. No previous knowledge of pattern recognition or
              machine learning concepts is assumed. Familiarity with
              multivariate calculus and basic linear algebra is required, and
              some experience in the use of probabilities would be helpful
              though not essential as the book includes a self-contained
              introduction to basic probability theory. The book is suitable for
              courses on machine learning, statistics, computer science, signal
              processing, computer vision, data mining, and bioinformatics.
              Extensive support is provided for course instructors, including
              more than 400 exercises, graded according to difficulty. Example
              solutions for a subset of the exercises are available from the
              book web site, while solutions for the remainder can be obtained
              by instructors from the publisher. The book is supported by a
              great deal of additional material, and the reader is encouraged to
              visit the book web site for the latest information. A forthcoming
              companion volume will deal with practical aspects of pattern
              recognition and machine learning, and will include free software
              implementations of the key algorithms along with example data sets
              and demonstration programs. Christopher Bishop is Assistant

              spontaneous speech and infant-directed speech) poses challenges

              possibility, this work proposes a new method for characterizing
              speaking style (the modulation spectrum), examines spontaneous,

                 spectrum, women are underrepresented in fields whose
                 practitioners believe that raw, innate talent is the main
                 requirement for success, because women are stereotyped as not
                 possessing such talent. This hypothesis extends to African
                 Americans' underrepresentation as well, as this group is
                 subject to similar stereotypes. Results from a nationwide
                 survey of academics support our hypothesis (termed the
                 field-specific ability beliefs hypothesis) over three competing
                 hypotheses.",

                 research tries to improve our understanding of social influence

                 facilitate OHC management, improve community sustainability,
                 and eventually benefit OHC users. METHODS: Through text mining
                 and sentiment analysis of users' online interactions, the
                 research revealed sentiment dynamics in threaded discussions. A
                 novel metric--the number of influential responding replies--was
                 proposed to directly measure a user's ability to affect the
                 sentiment of others. RESULTS: Using the dataset from a popular
                 OHC, the research demonstrated that the proposed metric is
                 highly effective in identifying influential users. In addition,
                 combining the metric with other traditional measures further
                 improves the identification of influential users.",

                 associated with female genital parts to explore how they may
                 affect the lived experience of people with these parts and the
                 quality of gynaecological care they receive. Specifically, we
                 examine the implications of using the word 'vagina' to replace
                 the word 'vulva', or indeed to indicate the entire female
                 genitalia. This article does so through an analysis of existing
                 scholarly work and through text mining methods such as word
                 frequencies, most distinctive word collocates and
                 word-embeddings drawn from literary and women's magazine
                 corpora. We find that words indicating specific female genital
                 parts are very infrequently mentioned in our corpora, which
                 shows that there is a troubling lack of exposure and education
                 in our socio-cultural context when it comes to the female
                 genital anatomy. When they are mentioned, their usage reflects
                 historical and patriarchal associations that have been
                 primarily attached to the word 'vagina'. When it comes to the
                 'vagina' and 'vulva', the penis is the most prevalent
                 association by far; whereas the most commonly occurring female
                 genital parts are parts to do with reproduction-reinforcing a
                 long-standing and disproportionate emphasis on the female
                 genitalia's reproductive function. Our research also reveals a
                 concerning emphasis on non-evidence-based female hygiene
                 products, thus perpetuating the damaging stereotype of the
                 dirty vagina. These findings may explain many negative patient
                 outcomes such as stigma attached to seeking out timely
                 gynaecological care, lack of informed medical consent and
                 non-evidence-based practices exacerbated by problematic
                 cultural depictions of the female genitalia. They can also
                 explain the neglect of female sexual agency, pleasure and
                 well-being. Understanding historical and contemporary usages of
                 words for the female genitalia has important implications for
                 the quality of patient care today and is a critical component
                 of gender and reproductive justice.",

               without relying on a controlled vocabulary. Tagging systems have
               the potential to improve search, spam detection, reputation
               systems, and personal organization while introducing new
               modalities of social communication and opportunities for data

               that underlies many of the current systems.Despite the rapid
               expansion of applications that support tagging of resources,
               tagging systems are still not well studied or understood. In this
               paper, we provide a short description of the academic related
               work to date. We offer a model of tagging systems, specifically
               in the context of web-based systems, to help us illustrate the
               possible benefits of these tools. Since many such systems already

              present an efficient and effective two- stage approach to
              disambiguate names. In the first stage, two novel topic-based
              models are proposed by extending two hierarchical Bayesian text
              models, namely Probabilistic La- tent Semantic Analysis (PLSA) and
              Latent Dirichlet Alloca- tion (LDA). Our models explicitly
              introduce a new variable for persons and learn the distribution of
              topics with regard to persons and words. After learning an initial
              model, the topic distributions are treated as feature sets and
              names are disambiguated by leveraging a hierarchical agglomera-
              tive clustering method. Experiments on web data and sci- entific

  abstract = "Typical pseudo-relevance feedback methods assume the top-
              retrieved documents are relevant and use these pseudo-relevant
              documents to expand terms. The initial retrieval set can, however,
              contain a great deal of noise. In this paper, we present a
              cluster- based resampling method to select better pseudo-relevant
              documents based on the relevance model. The main idea is to use
              document clusters to find dominant documents for the initial
              retrieval set, and to repeatedly feed the documents to emphasize
              the core topics of a query. Experimental results on large-scale
              web TREC collections show significant improvements over the
              relevance model. For justification of the resampling approach, we
              examine relevance density of feedback documents. A higher
              relevance density will result in greater retrieval accuracy,
              ultimately approaching true relevance feedback. The resampling
              approach shows higher relevance density than the baseline
              relevance model on all collections, resulting in better retrieval
              accuracy in pseudo-relevance feedback. This result indicates that

              accurately normalize the recognized entities, i.e., to map surface
              forms to unambiguous references to real world entities. Within the
              context of structured databases, this task (known as record
              linkage and data de-duplication) has been a topic of active
              research for more than five decades. For edited content, such as
              news articles, the named entity normalization (NEN) task is one
              that has recently attracted considerable attention. We consider
              the task in the challenging context of user generated content
              (UGC), where it forms a key ingredient of tracking and
              media-analysis systems. A baseline NEN system from the literature
              (that normalizes surface forms to Wikipedia pages) performs
              considerably worse on UGC than on edited news: accuracy drops from
              80 \% to 65 \% for a Dutch language data set and from 94 \% to 77
              \% for English. We identify several sources of errors: entity
              recognition errors, multiple ways of referring to the same entity
              and ambiguous references. To address these issues we propose five
              improvements to the baseline NEN algorithm, to arrive at a
              language independent NEN system that achieves overall accuracy
              scores of 90 \% on the English data set and 89 \% on the Dutch
              data set. We show that each of the improvements contributes to the
              overall score of our improved NEN algorithm, and conclude with an
              error analysis on both Dutch and English language UGC. The NEN
              system is computationally efficient and runs with very modest
              computational requirements.",

               annotate resources with personalized tags. The complex network
               created by many annotations, often called a folksonomy, permits
               users the freedom to explore tags, resources or even other user's
               profiles unbound from a rigid predefined conceptual hierarchy.
               However, the freedom afforded users comes at a cost: an
               uncontrolled vocabulary can result in tag redundancy and
               ambiguity hindering navigation. Data mining techniques, such as
               clustering, provide a means to remedy these problems by
               identifying trends and reducing noise. Tag clusters can also be
               used as the basis for effective personalized recommendation
               assisting users in navigation. We present a personalization
               algorithm for recommendation in folksonomies which relies on
               hierarchical tag clusters. Our basic recommendation framework is
               independent of the clustering method, but we use a
               context-dependent variant of hierarchical agglomerative
               clustering which takes into account the user's current navigation
               context in cluster selection. We present extensive experimental
               results on two real world dataset. While the personalization
               algorithm is successful in both cases, our results suggest that
               folksonomies encompassing only one topic domain, rather than many
               topics, present an easier target for recommendation, perhaps
               because they are more focused and often less sparse. Furthermore,
               context dependent cluster selection, an integral step in our
               personalization algorithm, demonstrates more utility for
               recommendation in multi-topic folksonomies than in single-topic
               folksonomies. This observation suggests that topic selection is
               an important strategy for recommendation in multi-topic
               folksonomies.",

              extensive empirical analysis for an automatic query expansion
              framework in which model estimation is cast as a robust
              constrained optimization problem. This framework provides a
              powerful method for modeling and solving complex expansion
              problems, by allowing multiple sources of domain knowledge or
              evidence to be encoded as simultaneous optimization constraints.
              Our robust optimization approach provides a clean theoretical way
              to model not only expansion benefit, but also expansion risk, by
              optimizing over uncertainty sets for the data. In addition, we
              introduce risk-reward curves to visualize expansion algorithm
              performance and analyze parameter sensitivity. We show that a
              robust approach significantly reduces the number and magnitude of
              expansion failures for a strong baseline algorithm, with no loss
              in average gain. Our approach is implemented as a highly efficient
              post-processing step that assumes little about the baseline
              expansion method used as input, making it easy to apply to
              existing expansion methods. We provide analysis showing that this
              approach is a natural and effective way to do selective expansion,
              automatically reducing or avoiding expansion in risky scenarios,
              and successfully attenuating noise in poor baseline methods.",

              to have a significant positive effect on retrieval performance,
              especially for tasks such as web search, where relevance at high
              ranks is particularly critical. Most previous work, however,
              treats all concepts as equally important, an assumption that often
              does not hold, especially for longer, more complex queries. In
              this paper, we show that one of the most effective existing term
              dependence models can be naturally extended by assigning weights
              to concepts. We demonstrate that the weighted dependence model can
              be trained using existing learning-to-rank techniques, even with a
              relatively small number of training queries. Our study compares
              the effectiveness of both endogenous (collection-based) and
              exogenous (based on external sources) features for determining
              concept importance. To test the weighted dependence model, we

              behaviour and performance. We conducted field experiments in real

              output not only causes a substantial amount of eye glances, but
              also led to a decrease in driving performance. Adding audio output
              decreased the number of eye glances, but we found no significant
              effects on driving performance. Although the audio configuration
              implied much fewer eye glances and improved driving performance,

              their information needs, mechanisms for automatically correcting
              misspelled queries are required. Online spelling correction aims
              to provide spell corrected completion suggestions as a query is

              suggestions, such an algorithm needs to be not only accurate, but

              correction pairs, we train a Markov n-gram transformation model

  abstract = "Entity Linking (EL) is the task of linking name mentions in Web
              text with their referent entities in a knowledge base. Traditional
              EL methods usually link name mentions in a document by assuming
              them to be independent. However, there is often additional
              interdependence between different EL decisions, i.e., the entities
              in the same document should be semantically related to each other.
              In these cases, Collective Entity Linking, in which the name
              mentions in the same document are linked jointly by exploiting the
              interdependence between them, can improve the entity linking
              accuracy. This paper proposes a graph-based collective EL method,
              which can model and exploit the global interdependence between
              different EL decisions. Specifically, we first propose a
              graph-based representation, called Referent Graph, which can model
              the global interdependence between different EL decisions. Then we
              propose a collective inference algorithm, which can jointly infer
              the referent entities of all name mentions by exploiting the
              interdependence captured in Referent Graph. The key benefit of our
              method comes from: 1) The global interdependence model of EL
              decisions; 2) The purely collective nature of the inference
              algorithm, in which evidence for related EL decisions can be
              reinforced into high-probability decisions. Experimental results
              show that our method can achieve significant performance
              improvement over the traditional EL methods.",

              largely caused by the inaccuracy with which a query formed by a
              few keywords models the actual user information need. One well
              known method to overcome this limitation is automatic query
              expansion (AQE), whereby the user's original query is augmented by
              new features with a similar meaning. AQE has a long history in the

              purpose of marketing, intelligence, and reputation management.
              Streams of microblogs are of great value because of their direct
              and real-time nature. Determining what an individual microblog
              post is about, however, can be non-trivial because of creative
              language usage, the highly contextualized and informal nature of
              microblog posts, and the limited length of this form of
              communication. We propose a solution to the problem of determining
              what a microblog post is about through semantic linking: we add
              semantics to posts by automatically identifying concepts that are
              semantically related to it and generating links to the
              corresponding Wikipedia articles. The identified concepts can
              subsequently be used for, e.g., social media mining, thereby
              reducing the need for manual inspection and selection. Using a
              purpose-built test collection of tweets, we show that recently
              proposed approaches for semantic linking do not perform well,
              mainly due to the idiosyncratic nature of microblog posts. We
              propose a novel method based on machine learning with a set of
              innovative features and show that it is able to achieve
              significant improvements over all other methods, especially in

  abstract = "Insights into human visual attention have benefited many areas of
              computing, but perhaps most significantly visualisation and UI
              design [3]. With the proliferation of mobile devices capable of
              supporting significantly complex applications on small screens,
              demands on mobile UI design and the user's visual system are
              becoming greater. In this paper, we report results from an
              empirical study of human visual attention, specifically the Change
              Blindness phenomenon, on handheld mobile devices and its impact on
              mobile UI design. It is arguable that due to the small size of the
              screen - unlike a typical computer monitor - a greater visual
              coverage of the mobile device is possible, and that these
              phenomena may occur less frequently during the use of the device,
              or even that they may not occur at all. Our study shows otherwise.
              We tested for Change Blindness (CB) and Inattentional Blindness
              (IB) in a single-modal, mobile context and attempted to establish
              factors in the application interface design that induce and/or
              reduce their occurrences. The results show that both CB and IB can
              and do occur while using mobile devices. The results also suggest
              that the number of separate attendable items on-screen is directly
              proportional to rates of CB. Newly inserted objects were correctly
              identified more often than changes applied to existing on-screen
              objects. These results suggest that it is important for mobile UI
              designers to take these aspects of visual attention into account
              when designing mobile applications that attempt to deliver
              information through visual changes or notifications.",

              extraction and aims to identify atomic entities in text that fall
              into predefined categories such as person, location, organization,
              etc. Recent efforts in NER try to extract entities and link them
              to linked data entities. Linked data is a term used for data
              resources that are created using semantic web standards such as
              DBpedia. There are a number of online tools that try to identify
              named entities in text and link them to linked data resources.
              Although one can use these tools via their APIs and web
              interfaces, they use different data resources and different
              techniques to identify named entities and not all of them reveal
              this information. One of the major tasks in NER is disambiguation
              that is identifying the right entity among a number of entities
              with the same names; for example ``apple'' standing for both
              ``Apple, Inc.'' the company and the fruit. We developed a similar
              tool called NERSO, short for Named Entity Recognition Using
              Semantic Open Data, to automatically extract named entities,
              disambiguating and linking them to DBpedia entities. Our
              disambiguation method is based on constructing a graph of linked
              data entities and scoring them using a graph-based centrality
              algorithm. We evaluate our system by comparing its performance
              with two publicly available NER tools. The results show that NERSO

              learning has spread rapidly throughout computer science and

              extraction. This paper focuses on disambiguating names in a Web or
              text document by jointly mapping all names onto semantically
              related entities registered in a knowledge base. To this end, we
              have developed a novel notion of semantic relatedness between two
              entities represented as sets of weighted (multi-word) keyphrases,
              with consideration of partially overlapping phrases. This measure
              improves the quality of prior link-based models, and also
              eliminates the need for (usually Wikipedia-centric) explicit
              interlinkage between entities. Thus, our method is more versatile
              and can cope with long-tail and newly emerging entities that have
              few or no links associated with them. For efficiency, we have
              developed approximation techniques based on min-hash sketches and
              locality-sensitive hashing. Our experiments on semantic
              relatedness and on named entity disambiguation demonstrate the

               Facilitating teams has become one of the main design principles

               evidence that collaborating on tasks in game teams can produce

               with repeated teammates, and we then identify different types of

               players are two distinct populations and they are highly

  abstract = "Named entity disambiguation is the task of disambiguating named
              entity mentions in natural language text and link them to their
              corresponding entries in a knowledge base such as Wikipedia. Such
              disambiguation can help enhance readability and add semantics to
              plain text. It is also a central step in constructing high-quality
              information network or knowledge graph from unstructured text.
              Previous research has tackled this problem by making use of vari-
              ous textual and structural features from a knowledge base. Most of
              the proposed algorithms assume that a knowledge base can provide
              enough explicit and useful information to help disambiguate a
              mention to the right entity. However, the existing knowledge bases
              are rarely complete (likely will never be), thus leading to poor
              performance on short queries with not well-known contexts. In such
              cases, we need to collect additional evidences scattered in
              internal and external corpus to augment the knowledge bases and
              enhance their disambiguation power. In this work, we propose a
              generative model and an incremental algorithm to automatically
              mine useful evidences across documents. With a specific modeling
              of ``background topic'' and``unknown entities'', our model is able
              to harvest useful evidences out of noisy information. Experimental
              results show that our proposed method outperforms the
              state-of-the-art approaches significantly: boosting the
              disambiguation accuracy from 43\% (baseline) to 86\% on short

              changes to the membership and its social dynamics. Linguistic
              change--in the sense of innovation that becomes accepted as the
              norm--is essential to this dynamic process: it both facilitates
              indi- vidual expression and fosters the emergence of a collective
              identity. We propose a framework for tracking linguistic change as
              it hap- pens and for understanding how specific users react to
              these evolv- ing norms. By applying this framework to two large
              online commu- nities we show that users follow a determined
              two-stage lifecycle with respect to their susceptibility to
              linguistic change: a linguisti- cally innovative learning phase in
              which users adopt the language of the community followed by a
              conservative phase in which users stop changing and the evolving
              community norms pass them by. Building on this observation, we
              show how this framework can be used to detect, early in a user's
              career, how long she will stay active in the community. Thus, this

              perform these two steps using a pipeline architecture: they use a
              Named Entity Recognition (NER) system to find the boundaries of
              mentions in text, and an Entity Linking (EL) system to connect the
              mentions to entries in structured or semi-structured repositories
              like Wikipedia. However, the two tasks are tightly coupled, and
              each type of system can benefit significantly from the kind of
              information provided by the other. We present a joint model for
              NER and EL, called NEREL, that takes a large set of candidate men-
              tions from typical NER systems and a large set of candidate entity
              links from EL systems, and ranks the candidate mention-entity
              pairs together to make joint predictions. In NER and EL

              with this deeper level of understanding, a web-scale entity
              linking system must have 3 key properties: First, its feature
              extraction must be robust to the diversity of web documents and
              their var- ied writing styles and content structures. Second, it
              must maintain high-precision linking for ``tail'' (unpopular)
              entities that is robust to the existence of confounding entities
              outside of the knowledge base and entity profiles with minimal
              information. Finally, the system must represent large-scale
              knowledge bases with a scalable and powerful feature
              representation. We have built and deployed a web-scale
              unsupervised entity linking system for a commercial search engine
              that addresses these requirements by combining new developments in
              sparse signal recovery to identify the most discriminative
              features from noisy, free-text web documents; explicit modeling of
              out-of-knowledge-base entities to improve precision at the tail;
              and the development of a new phrase-unigram language model to
              efficiently capture high-order dependencies in lexical features.
              Using a knowledge base of 100M unique people from a popular social
              networking site, we present experimental results in the
              challenging domain of people-linking at the tail, where most
              entities have limited web presence. Our experimental results show
              that this system substantially improves on the precision-recall
              tradeoff over baseline methods, achieving precision over 95\% with
              recall over 60\%.",

              other communities. We measured a community's relationship with
              other communities-its ``niche''-through four dimensions: Topic
              overlap, shared members, content linking, and shared offline

               analyze how search behavior as well as browsing and clicking
               patterns change during a search session in these different tasks.
               Our results indicate that user behavior in the four types of
               tasks differ in various aspects, including search activeness,
               browsing style, clicking strategy, and query reformulation. As a
               search session progresses, we note that users shift their
               interests to focus less on the top results but more on results
               ranked at lower positions in browsing. We also found that results
               eventually become less and less attractive for the users. The
               reasons vary and include downgraded search performance of query,
               decreased novelty of search results, and decaying persistence of
               users in browsing. Our study highlights the lack of long session
               support in existing search engines and suggests different
               strategies of supporting longer sessions according to different
               task types.",

                 and heritage, but also has implications for social status and
                 the degree of integration in society. Different languages can
                 be a barrier between monolingual communities, and the dynamics
                 of language choice could explain the prosperity or demise of
                 local languages in an international setting. We study this
                 interplay of language and network structure in diverse,
                 multi-lingual societies, using Twitter. In our analysis, we are
                 particularly interested in the role of bilinguals. Concretely,
                 we attempt to quantify the degree to which users are the
                 ``bridge-builders'' between monolingual language groups, while
                 monolingual users cluster together. Also, with the revalidation
                 of English as a lingua franca on Twitter, we reveal users of
                 the native non-English language have higher influence than
                 English users, and the language convergence pattern is
                 consistent across the regions. Furthermore, we explore for
                 which topics these users prefer their native language rather
                 than English. To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest

              be in an attentional state that makes one susceptible to
              communications typically associated with distraction. We explore
              the confluence of multitasking and workplace communications from
              three temporal perspectives -- prior to an interaction, when tasks
              and communications are interleaved, and at the end of the day.
              Using logging techniques and experience sampling, we observed 32
              employees in situ for five days. We found that certain attentional
              states lead people to be more susceptible to particular types of
              interaction. Rote work is followed by more Facebook or
              face-to-face interaction. Focused and aroused states are followed

                 support. However, concerns for misinformation being shared
                 around clinical information persist. An existing practice
                 addressing this concern includes monitoring and, as needed,
                 discouraging asking clinical questions in the community. In
                 this paper, I examine such practice where moderators redirected
                 patients to see their health care providers instead of
                 consulting the community. I observed that, contrary to common
                 beliefs, community members provided constructive tips and
                 persuaded the patients to see doctors rather than attempting to
                 make a diagnosis or give medical advice. Moderators' posts on
                 redirecting patients to see their providers were highly
                 associated with no more follow up replies, potentially
                 hindering active community dynamic. The findings showed what is
                 previously thought of as a solution-quality control through
                 moderation-might not be best and that the community, in
                 coordination with moderators, can provide critical help in

               social media is increasingly adopted in health related discourse,
               we examine how these new platforms might be allowing honest and
               candid expression of thoughts, experiences and beliefs.
               Specifically, we seek to detect levels of self-disclosure
               manifested in posts shared on different mental health forums on
               Reddit. We develop a classifier for the purpose based on content
               features. The classifier is able to characterize a Reddit post to
               be of high, low, or no self-disclosure with 78\% accuracy.
               Applying this classifier to general mental health discourse on
               Reddit, we find that bulk of such discourse is characterized by
               high self-disclosure, and that the community responds
               distinctively to posts that disclose less or more. We conclude
               with the potential of harnessing our proposed self-disclosure
               detection algorithm in psychological therapy via social media. We
               also discuss design considerations for improved community
               moderation and support in these vulnerable self-disclosing

               In particular, much stress is put upon socializing and

               emotionally moving, their causes and effects, and whether players
               find these experiences rewarding at all. We analyzed 121 players'
               accounts of emotionally moving game experiences in terms of the
               feelings and thoughts they evoked, different PX constructs, as
               well as game-related and personal factors contributing to these.
               We found that most players enjoyed and appreciated experiencing
               negatively valenced emotions, such as sadness. Emotions were
               evoked by a variety of interactive and non-interactive game
               aspects, such as in-game loss, character attachment and (lack of)
               agency, but also personal memories, and were often accompanied by

               general and aspect-specific opinions. Various topic models have
               been proposed by researchers to address some of these sub-tasks.
               However, there is little work on modeling all of them together.
               In this paper, we first propose a holistic fine-grained topic
               model, called the JAST (Joint Aspectbased Sentiment Topic) model,
               that can simultaneously model all of above problems under a
               unified framework. To further improve it, we incorporate the idea
               of lifelong machine learning and propose a more advanced model,
               called the LAST (Lifelong Aspectbased Sentiment Topic) model.
               LAST automatically mines the prior knowledge of aspect, opinion,
               and their correspondence from other products or domains. Such
               knowledge is automatically extracted and incorporated into the
               proposed LAST model without any human involvement. Our
               experiments using reviews of a large number of product domains
               show major improvements of the proposed models over

               icebreakers), and creating a context of risk and interdependence
               (e.g., trust falls). However, because these strategies are
               difficult to implement in an online setting, trust is more
               difficult to achieve and preserve in distributed teams. In this
               paper, we argue that games are an optimal environment for trust
               formation because they can simulate both risk and
               interdependence. Results of our online experiment show that a
               social game can be more effective than a social task at fostering
               interpersonal trust. Furthermore, trust formation through the
               game is reliable, but trust depends on several contingencies in
               the social task. Our work suggests that gameplay interactions do
               not merely promote impoverished versions of the rich ties formed
               through conversation; but rather engender genuine social bonds.

               on the type of guest engagement expected. We also examine the
               perceived trustworthiness of profiles using topic-coded profiles
               from 1,200 hosts, showing that longer self-descriptions are
               perceived to be more trustworthy. Further, we show that there are
               common strategies (a mix of topics) hosts use in self-disclosure,

               rumors during crisis events. Focusing on Twitter, we identify
               different patterns of information correcting behaviors and
               describe the actions, motivations, rationalizations and
               experiences of people who exhibited them. To do this, we analyze
               digital traces across two separate crisis events and interviews
               of fifteen individuals who generated some of those traces.
               Salient themes ensuing from this work help us describe: 1)
               different mechanisms of corrective action with respect to who
               gets corrected and how; 2) how responsibility is positioned for
               verifying and correcting information; and 3) how users' imagined
               audience influences their corrective strategy. We synthesize
               these three components into a preliminary model and explore the
               role of imagined audiences-both who those audiences are and how
               they react to and interact with shared information-in shaping
               users' decisions about whether and how to correct rumors.",

                 in online health communities. Sometimes, patients' conflicting
                 opinions toward CAM-related issues trigger debates in the
                 community. The objectives of this paper are to identify such
                 debates, identify controversial CAM therapies in a popular
                 online breast cancer community, as well as patients' stances
                 towards them. To scale our analysis, we trained a set of
                 classifiers. We first constructed a supervised classifier based
                 on a long short-term memory neural network (LSTM) stacked over
                 a convolutional neural network (CNN) to detect automatically
                 CAM-related debates from a popular breast cancer forum.
                 Members' stances in these debates were also identified by a
                 CNN-based classifier. Finally, posts automatically flagged as
                 debates by the classifier were analyzed to explore which
                 specific CAM therapies trigger debates more often than others.
                 Our methods are able to detect CAM debates with F score of
                 77\%, and identify stances with F score of 70\%. The debate
                 classifier identified about 1/6 of all CAM-related posts as
                 debate. About 60\% of CAM-related debate posts represent the
                 supportive stance toward CAM usage. Qualitative analysis shows
                 that some specific therapies, such as Gerson therapy and usage
                 of laetrile, trigger debates frequently among members of the
                 breast cancer community. This study demonstrates that neural
                 networks can effectively locate debates on usage and
                 effectiveness of controversial CAM therapies, and can help make
                 sense of patients' opinions on such issues under dispute. As to
                 CAM for breast cancer, perceptions of their effectiveness vary
                 among patients. Many of the specific therapies trigger debates
                 frequently and are worth more exploration in future work.",

               player's actions and decisions. For example, choosing whether to
               save some innocent people instead of rescuing a player
               character's friend or lover. We use virtue ethics as a lens for

               significant, impactful, and more importantly meaningful. We
               conclude by outlining future research questions and discussing

               interested in obtaining and evaluating entire collections of

               these user needs: (1) we replaced the Web page with the Web site
               as the basic unit of interaction and analysis;(2) we defined a
               new informationstructure, the clan graph, that groups together

               site with a site profile, information about site structure and
               content that helps inform user evaluation of a site; and (4) we

              Instead, salient words and phrases extracted from the documents
              are organized hierarchically using a type of co-occurrence known
              as subsumption. The resulting structure is displayed as a series
              of hierarchical menus. When generated from a set of retrieved
              documents, a user browsing the menus is provided with a detailed
              overview of their content in a manner distinct from existing
              overview and summarization techniques. The methods used to build
              the structure are simple, but appear to be effective: a
              small-scale user study reveals that the generated hierarchy
              possesses properties expected of such a structure in that general

              moderation approach remains unclear: banning might diminish
              hateful behavior, or it may relocate such behavior to different
              parts of the site. We study the ban of r/fatpeoplehate and
              r/CoonTown in terms of its effect on both participating users and
              affected subreddits. Working from over 100M Reddit posts and
              comments, we generate hate speech lexicons to examine variations
              in hate speech usage via causal inference methods. We find that
              the ban worked for Reddit. More accounts than expected
              discontinued using the site; those that stayed drastically
              decreased their hate speech usage--by at least 80\%. Though many
              subreddits saw an influx of r/fatpeoplehate and r/CoonTown
              ``migrants,'' those subreddits saw no significant changes in hate
              speech usage. In other words, other subreddits did not inherit the

               little empirical attention. It remains unclear whether players

               on the themes developed in this first study, a quantitative study

               cooperation appears to be less crucial than common wisdom

               technology has proposed applications in physical access control,
               data analytics and advertising. Within academia, it is already
               used in the field of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) to analyse
               social media usage. Given the long-running critiques of HCI for
               failing to consider and include transgender (trans) perspectives
               in research, and the potential implications of AGR for trans
               people if deployed, I sought to understand how AGR and HCI
               understand the term ``gender'', and how HCI describes and deploys
               gender recognition technology. Using a content analysis of papers

               gender in a trans-exclusive way, and consequently carries
               disproportionate risk for trans people subject to it. In
               addition, I use the dearth of discussion of this in HCI papers
               that apply AGR to discuss how HCI operationalises gender, and the
               implications that this has for the field's research. I conclude
               with recommendations for alternatives to AGR, and some ideas for
               how HCI can work towards a more effective and trans-inclusive

  abstract  = "Conspiracy theories are omnipresent in online
               discussions---whether to explain a late-breaking event that still
               lacks official report or to give voice to political dissent.
               Conspiracy theories evolve, multiply, and interconnect, further
               complicating efforts to understand them and to limit their
               propagation. It is therefore crucial to develop scalable methods
               to examine the nature of conspiratorial discussions in online
               communities. What do users talk about when they discuss
               conspiracy theories online? What are the recurring elements in
               their discussions? What do these elements tell us about the way
               users think? This work answers these questions by analyzing over
               ten years of discussions in r/conspiracy---an online community on
               Reddit dedicated to conspiratorial discussions. We focus on the
               key elements of a conspiracy theory: the conspiratorial agents,
               the actions they perform, and their targets. By computationally
               detecting agent?action?target triplets in conspiratorial
               statements, and grouping them into semantically coherent
               clusters, we develop a notion of narrative-motif to detect
               recurring patterns of triplets. For example, a narrative-motif
               such as ``governmental agency-controls-communications''
               represents the various ways in which multiple conspiratorial
               statements denote how governmental agencies control information.
               Thus, narrative-motifs expose commonalities between multiple
               conspiracy theories even when they refer to different events or
               circumstances. In the process, these representations help us
               understand how users talk about conspiracy theories and offer us
               a means to interpret what they talk about. Our approach enables a
               population-scale study of conspiracy theories in alternative news
               and social media with implications for understanding their
               adoption and combating their spread.",

               machine-learning based systems that, once introduced into a
               social context, can achieve social and legal outcomes such as
               fairness, justice, and due process. Bedrock concepts in computer
               science---such as abstraction and modular design---are used to
               define notions of fairness and discrimination, to produce
               fairness-aware learning algorithms, and to intervene at different
               stages of a decision-making pipeline to produce ``fair''
               outcomes. In this paper, however, we contend that these concepts
               render technical interventions ineffective, inaccurate, and
               sometimes dangerously misguided when they enter the societal
               context that surrounds decision-making systems. We outline this
               mismatch with five ``traps'' that fair-ML work can fall into even
               as it attempts to be more context-aware in comparison to
               traditional data science. We draw on studies of sociotechnical
               systems in Science and Technology Studies to explain why such
               traps occur and how to avoid them. Finally, we suggest ways in
               which technical designers can mitigate the traps through a
               refocusing of design in terms of process rather than solutions,
               and by drawing abstraction boundaries to include social actors
               rather than purely technical ones.",

               needed in light of advances in AI and the growing uses of AI

               These guidelines are validated through multiple rounds of
               evaluation including a user study with 49 design practitioners
               who tested the guidelines against 20 popular AI-infused products.
               The results verify the relevance of the guidelines over a
               spectrum of interaction scenarios and reveal gaps in our
               knowledge, highlighting opportunities for further research. Based
               on the evaluations, we believe the set of design guidelines can

               media to seek both informational and emotional support, but these
               individuals also face social and health-related challenges in
               posting about their often-stigmatized conditions online. To
               understand how they evaluate different platforms for disclosure,
               we interviewed 19 people with ICIs who post on general social
               media about their illnesses, such as Facebook, Instagram, and
               Twitter. We present a cross-platform analysis of how platforms
               varied in their suitability to achieve participants' goals, as
               well as the challenges posed by each platform. We also found that
               as participants' ICIs progressed, their goals, challenges, and
               social media use similarly evolved over time. Our findings
               highlight how people with ICIs select platforms from a broader
               ecology of social media and suggest a general need to understand
               shifts in social media use for populations with chronic but
               changing health concerns.",

               information to others - in pursuit of social rewards. However,

               comments on 2202 news articles from four major English news
               websites. We start with detection of language indicative of
               various types of self-disclosure, leveraging both syntactic and
               semantic information present in texts. Specifically, we use
               dependency parsing for subject, verb, and object extraction from
               sentences, in conjunction with named entity recognition to
               extract linguistic indicators of self-disclosure. We then use
               these indicators to examine the effects of anonymity and topic of
               discussion on self-disclosure. We find that anonymous users are
               more likely to self-disclose than identifiable users, and that
               self-disclosure varies across topics of discussion. Finally, we
               discuss the implications of our findings for user privacy.",

               behavior, such as harassment, can create barriers to players

               investigate how players define, experience and deal with toxicity
               in esports games that they play. Our findings from an interview
               study and five monthly follow ups with 19 participants from a
               university esports club show that players define toxicity as
               behaviors disrupt their morale and team dynamics, and are
               inclined to normalize negative behaviors, rationalize it as part
               of the competitive game culture akin to traditional sports, and
               participate a form of gamer classism, believing that toxicity is
               more common in lower level play than in professional and

               collegiate esports players, including ignoring offenders,
               deescalating tense encounters, and using tools to mute offenders.
               Understanding the motivations behind collegiate esports players'

               in improving HCI and user experience. Yet many challenges persist
               in designing and innovating valuable human-AI interactions. For
               example, AI systems can make unpredictable errors, and these
               errors damage UX and even lead to undesired societal impact.
               However, HCI routinely grapples with complex technologies and
               mitigates their unintended consequences. What makes AI different?
               What makes human-AI interaction appear particularly difficult to
               design? This paper investigates these questions. We synthesize
               prior research, our own design and research experience, and our
               observations when teaching human-AI interaction. We identify two
               sources of AI's distinctive design challenges: 1) uncertainty
               surrounding AI's capabilities, 2) AI's output complexity,
               spanning from simple to adaptive complex. We identify four levels
               of AI systems. On each level, designers encounter a different
               subset of the design challenges. We demonstrate how these
               findings reveal new insights for designers, researchers, and
               design tool makers in productively addressing the challenges of
               human-AI interaction going forward.",

               the means by which restoration occurs. We employed

               Sixty-five participants worked at a competence manipulation task

               (newer) authors of posts and comments on r/science use less

               between peers that transcend national and cultural boundaries.
               While past work in medical anthropology indicates a central role
               of cultural identity in how individuals frame their mental
               well-being and distress, little research has been done to
               investigate the role of culture in seeking and providing mental
               health support on online forums. Using data from two mental
               health forums, we analyze cross-cultural differences in mental
               health expression between people from different countries. We
               characterize these differences along three dimensions--identity,
               language use, and support behavior. Through comparing usage of
               the platform by individuals from three Asian countries with their
               counterparts from primarily Western countries, we find that
               individuals from these less-represented countries mention their
               own country more often when expressing distress, use fewer
               clinical language terms, and are more likely to provide support
               to people from the same country as them, as expected from past
               work on mental health in these countries. Contrary to past work,
               however, we find that the use of clinical mental health language
               is not affected over time by interacting with others in an
               international forum. While these findings are useful for
               understanding the role of culture in mental health support, they
               also have practical design implications for online forums. We
               find that the three dimensions of cultural differences we analyze
               are correlated with receiving effective support, and make design
               recommendations that can improve quality of support for the
               people in the minority on these forums.",

               discourages many women from publicly sharing their stories,
               limiting their ability to seek support and obscuring the epidemic
               of sexual violence against women. By inviting women to share
               their ordinarily silenced stories, the hashtag \#MeToo surfaced a
               network of survivors to confront this stigma. Through a
               mixed-methods analysis of over 1.8 million tweets posted during
               the first two weeks after \#MeToo gained widespread popularity in
               2017, we map the landscape of disclosures that emerged and
               disentangle the effects of network-level reciprocal disclosures,
               or disclosures made in reaction to seeing others disclose. We
               detail how survivors disclosed a diversity of sexual violence
               experiences in solidarity with others, composing nearly half of
               all authored tweets and comprising a disproportionate number of
               interactions within the \#MeToo network. Further, we show that
               the more disclosures an individual potentially saw prior to
               disclosing, the more likely they were to share details with their
               disclosure. We argue that such network-level reciprocal
               disclosures may have reduced stigma, creating a counterpublic
               space safe for disclosure which, subsequently, generated more
               disclosures. Our work illustrates how feminist hashtag activism,
               like \#MeToo, can unify individual and collective narratives to
               dismantle the stigma surrounding disclosures of sexual violence.

               failure of platforms, including issues surrounding policy,
               design, and community. Further insights into the disruptive
               consequences of migrations (such as social fragmentation and lost
               content) suggest ways that platforms might both support
               commitment and better support migration when it occurs.",

               thoughts on social media has received much scholarly attention.
               Scholars have identified a variety of factors that affect
               disclosure behavior, but as platforms offer a wider range of
               affordances that enable more diverse user behaviors and nuanced
               audience segmentation, these influencing factors are increasingly
               intertwined. However, little is known about the interrelatedness
               of platform, affordance, and audience. Drawing on survey data of
               470 American adults during the COVID-19 pandemic, this study
               examines the interplay and relative strength of the factors
               influencing distress disclosure on social media. We introduce the
               concept of social media disclosure ecology as an analytical lens
               to understand online disclosure. The results suggest that
               perceived affordances (i.e., anonymity, persistence, visibility
               control) and relational closeness to audience separately and
               interactively predict the depth of distress disclosure, which in
               turn affects satisfaction with disclosure. This study contributes
               to the literature on online-disclosure and privacy, while

               understand both the conditions under which norms might be

               the cognitive mechanism of trust, and how can we promote them, or
               assess whether they are being satisfied in a given interaction?
               This work aims to answer these questions. We discuss a model of
               trust inspired by, but not identical to, interpersonal trust
               (i.e., trust between people) as defined by sociologists. This
               model rests on two key properties: the vulnerability of the user;
               and the ability to anticipate the impact of the AI model's
               decisions. We incorporate a formalization of 'contractual trust',
               such that trust between a user and an AI model is trust that some
               implicit or explicit contract will hold, and a formalization of

               activities, emotions, beliefs, or other reactions are relevant
               and meaningful given the circumstance. When people experience
               distressing, stigmatizing life events, their state of emotional
               validation and thus their perceived sense of normalcy is often
               disrupted. Online spaces offer opportunities for coping,
               managing, and making sense of distress and stigma. In this paper,
               we focus on pregnancy loss as the context of inquiry and as an
               important example of a disruptive experience that is also
               associated with stigma. We examine how online spaces help
               facilitate or disrupt the process of achieving emotional
               validation among pregnancy loss survivors. We conducted in-depth
               interviews with women in the United States who had recently
               experienced a pregnancy loss. We found that individuals seeking a
               sense of perceived normalcy after pregnancy loss engage in two
               forms of validation processes that result in emotional validation
               - informational and experiential. We identified encounters that
               disrupt the process of seeking, achieving, and maintaining
               emotional validation related to: information, designs,
               algorithms, and interpersonal interactions. We introduce the
               concept of algorithmic symbolic annihilation to describe the
               representational and emotional harm participants experienced when
               they felt they were targets of algorithms assuming that all
               desired pregnancies proceed as expected. Algorithmic symbolic
               annihilation refers to how algorithms perpetuate normative and
               stereotypical narratives about phenomena, where what they account
               for has power and authority, and what they do not account for
               does not. To aid in seeking, achieving and sustaining emotional
               validation among pregnancy loss survivors, we suggest designing
               for 1) representational belonging to combat symbolic annihilation
               and 2) information avoidance.",

               used mixed methods, combining behavioral log analysis, automated
               content analysis, surveys and interviews. We found that shifts in
               members' motivations seemed to be driven by two sources: the
               internal dynamics common to becoming a member of most online
               communities and the external needs associated with their cancer
               journey. When members' disease-driven needs for support

               who stayed shifted from receiving support to providing it to
               others in the community. As in many online communities,
               old-timers contributed the vast majority of content. However,
               they encountered challenges that threatened their commitment,
               including negative emotions related to other members' deaths,
               which led them to take leaves of absence from the community or to
               drop out permanently. Implications for the motivation changes

               However, empirically investigating trust is challenging. One
               reason is the lack of standard protocols to design trust
               experiments. In this paper, we present a survey of existing
               methods to empirically investigate trust in AI-assisted decision
               making and analyse the corpus along the constitutive elements of
               an experimental protocol. We find that the definition of trust is
               not commonly integrated in experimental protocols, which can lead
               to findings that are overclaimed or are hard to interpret and
               compare across studies. Drawing from empirical practices in

               quantitative scholars, who work with computational tools to
               derive numerical and descriptive insights. However, recent work
               asks how computational tools and other technologies, such as AI,
               can support qualitative scholars in developing deep and complex
               insights from large amounts of data. Addressing this question,
               Jiang et al. found that qualitative scholars are generally
               opposed to incorporating AI in their practices of data analysis.
               In this paper, we provide nuance to these earlier findings,
               showing that the stage of qualitative analysis matters for how
               scholars believe AI can and should be used. Through interviews
               with 15 CSCW and HCI qualitative researchers, we explore how AI
               can be included throughout different stages of qualitative
               analysis. We find that qualitative scholars are amenable to
               working with AI in diverse ways, such as for data exploration and
               coding, as long as it assists rather than automates their
               analytic work practice. Based on our analysis, we discuss how
               incorporating AI into qualitative research can shift some
               analytic practices, and how designing for human-AI collaboration
               in qualitative analysis necessitates considering tradeoffs in

               beneficial, and investigate what specific values the field is
               advancing. In this paper, we first introduce a method and
               annotation scheme for studying the values encoded in documents
               such as research papers. Applying the scheme, we analyze 100
               highly cited machine learning papers published at premier machine
               learning conferences, ICML and NeurIPS. We annotate key features
               of papers which reveal their values: their justification for
               their choice of project, which attributes of their project they
               uplift, their consideration of potential negative consequences,
               and their institutional affiliations and funding sources. We find
               that few of the papers justify how their project connects to a
               societal need (15\%) and far fewer discuss negative potential
               (1\%). Through line-by-line content analysis, we identify 59
               values that are uplifted in ML research, and, of these, we find

               potentially flawed systems, without interrogating the deeper
               structural inequalities underlying them. There are not yet

               learning-based tools that center and aim to challenge power
               inequalities. Our work targets this more prospective goal. Guided
               by the framework of data feminism, we co-design datasets and
               machine learning models to support the efforts of activists who
               collect and monitor data about feminicide -- gender-based
               killings of women and girls. We describe how intersectional
               feminist goals and participatory processes shaped each stage of
               our approach, from problem conceptualization to data collection
               to model evaluation. We highlight several methodological

               framing concepts (such as who is included/excluded in
               ``feminicide''), 2) models that explicitly focus on
               intersectional identities rather than statistical majorities, and
               3) a multi-step evaluation process -- with quantitative,

               context-specific relevance. We also distill insights and tensions

               pluralism, rethink binaries and consider context, as well as the

               With interpretability approaches, ML can now offer explanations
               for its outputs to aid human understanding. Though these
               approaches rely on guidelines for how humans explain things to

               identity, social context, environmental cues, etc.) that shape
               human understanding. We use an application of sensemaking in

               artificial intelligence (AI) explainability and trust in AI,
               providing a case for expressions, such as ``explainability
               fosters trust in AI,'' that commonly appear in the literature.
               This explanation relates the justification of the trustworthiness
               of an AI with the need to monitor it during its use. We discuss
               the latter by referencing an account of trust, called ``trust as
               anti-monitoring,'' that different authors contributed developing.
               We focus our analysis on the case of medical AI systems, noting
               that our proposal is compatible with internalist and externalist
               justifications of trustworthiness of medical AI and recent
               accounts of warranted contractual trust. We propose that
               ``explainability fosters trust in AI'' if and only if it fosters
               justified and warranted paradigmatic trust in AI, i.e., trust in
               the presence of the justified belief that the AI is trustworthy,
               which, in turn, causally contributes to rely on the AI in the
               absence of monitoring. We argue that our proposed approach can
               intercept the complexity of the interactions between physicians
               and medical AI systems in clinical practice, as it can
               distinguish between cases where humans hold different beliefs on
               the trustworthiness of the medical AI and exercise varying
               degrees of monitoring on them. Finally, we apply our account to
               user's trust in AI, where, we argue, explainability does not
               contribute to trust. By contrast, when considering public trust
               in AI as used by a human, we argue, it is possible for
               explainability to contribute to trust. Our account can explain
               the apparent paradox that in order to trust AI, we must trust AI
               users not to trust AI completely. Summing up, we can explain how
               explainability contributes to justified trust in AI, without
               leaving a reliabilist framework, but only by redefining the
               trusted entity as an AI-user dyad.",

               (FATE)1 has established many sources and forms of algorithmic
               harm, in domains as diverse as health care, finance, policing,
               and recommendations. Much work remains to be done to mitigate the
               serious harms of these systems, particularly those
               disproportionately affecting marginalized communities. Despite
               these ongoing harms, new systems are being developed and
               deployed, typically without strong regulatory barriers,
               threatening the perpetuation of the same harms and the creation
               of novel ones. In response, the FATE community has emphasized the
               importance of anticipating harms, rather than just responding to
               them. Anticipation of harms is especially important given the
               rapid pace of developments in machine learning (ML). Our work
               focuses on the anticipation of harms from increasingly agentic
               systems. Rather than providing a definition of agency as a binary
               property, we identify 4 key characteristics which, particularly
               in combination, tend to increase the agency of a given
               algorithmic system: underspecification, directness of impact,
               goal-directedness, and long-term planning. We also discuss
               important harms which arise from increasing agency -- notably,
               these include systemic and/or long-range impacts, often on
               marginalized or unconsidered stakeholders. We emphasize that
               recognizing agency of algorithmic systems does not absolve or
               shift the human responsibility for algorithmic harms. Rather, we
               use the term agency to highlight the increasingly evident fact
               that ML systems are not fully under human control. Our work
               explores increasingly agentic algorithmic systems in three parts.
               First, we explain the notion of an increase in agency for
               algorithmic systems in the context of diverse perspectives on
               agency across disciplines. Second, we argue for the need to
               anticipate harms from increasingly agentic systems. Third, we
               discuss important harms from increasingly agentic systems and
               ways forward for addressing them. We conclude by reflecting on
               implications of our work for anticipating algorithmic harms from

              groups. However, distributions of various forms arise in many more
              aspects of the recommender systems experimental process, and
              distributional thinking has substantial ramifications for how we
              design, evaluate, and present recommender systems evaluation and
              research results. Leveraging and emphasizing distributions in the
              evaluation of recommender systems is a necessary step to ensure

               for identifying latent themes in a corpus of documents.
               Generating an exact solution (i.e., finding global optimum) is
               often computationally intractable. Various optimization
               techniques (e.g., Variational Bayes or Gibbs Sampling) are
               employed to generate topic solutions approximately by finding
               local optima. Such an approximation often begins with a random
               initialization, which leads to different results with different
               initializations. The term ``stability'' refers to a topic model's
               ability to produce solutions that are partially or completely
               identical across multiple runs with different random
               initializations. Although a variety of work has been done

               provided a thorough review of different stability metrics nor of
               various techniques that improved the stability of a topic model.

               access systems. While the interfaces may look appealing and the
               apparent breadth of applicability is exciting, we are concerned
               that the field is rushing ahead with a technology without
               sufficient study of the uses it is meant to serve, how it would
               be used, and what its use would mean. We argue that it is
               important to reassert the central research focus of the field of
               information retrieval, because information access is not merely
               an application to be solved by the so-called `AI' techniques du
               jour. Rather, it is a key human activity, with impacts on both
               individuals and society. As information scientists, we should be
               asking what do people and society want and need from information
               access systems and how do we design and build systems to meet
               those needs? With that goal, in this conceptual paper we
               investigate fundamental questions concerning information access
               from user and societal viewpoints. We revisit foundational work
               related to information behavior, information seeking, information
               retrieval, information filtering, and information access to
               resurface what we know about these fundamental questions and what
               may be missing. We then provide our conceptual framing about how
               we could fill this gap, focusing on methods as well as
               experimental and evaluation frameworks. We consider the Web as an
               information ecosystem and explore the ways in which synthetic
               media, produced by LLMs and otherwise, endangers that ecosystem.
               The primary goal of this conceptual paper is to shed light on
               what we still do not know about the potential impacts of
               LLM-based information access systems, how to advance our
               understanding of user behaviors, and where the next generations

              novel approach to predicting effects of in-car interfaces by
              modeling behavior in a cognitive architecture. A cognitive
              architecture is a theoretical frame-work for building
              computational models of cognition and performance. The proposed
              approach centers on integrating a user model for the interface
              with an existing driver model that accounts for basic aspects of
              driver behavior (e.g., steering and speed control). By running the
              integrated model and having it interact with the interface while
              driving, we can generate a priori predictions of the effects of
              interface use on driver performance. The paper illustrates the
              approach by comparing four representative dialing interfaces for
              an in-car, hands-free cellular phone. It also presents an

              general techniques which are applicable to many problems. At a
              mathematical level, this corresponds to approaches with provable
              guarantees under weakest-possible assumptions since real problems

               scribe program implementation, was used to quantitatively assess
               the impact of the scribe program on measures of ED throughput. An
               electronic survey was distributed to all emergency medicine
               residents and advanced practice providers to qualitatively assess
               the impact of the scribe program on providers. Results. Several
               throughput time measures were significantly lower in the
               postscribe group, compared to prescribe implementation, including
               time to disposition. The left without being seen (LWBS) decrease
               was not statistically significant. A total of 30 providers
               responded to the survey. 100\% of providers indicated scribes are

               text genre detection, author identification, and author
               verification tasks and show that the proposed method performs

              shown to exhibit undesirable word associations resulting from
              gender, racial, and religious biases. Existing post-processing
              methods for debiasing word embeddings are unable to mitigate
              gender bias hidden in the spatial arrangement of word vectors. In
              this paper, we propose RAN-Debias, a novel gender debiasing
              methodology that not only eliminates the bias present in a word
              vector but also alters the spatial distribution of its neighboring
              vectors, achieving a bias-free setting while maintaining minimal
              semantic offset. We also propose a new bias evaluation metric,
              Gender-based Illicit Proximity Estimate (GIPE), which measures the
              extent of undue proximity in word vectors resulting from the
              presence of gender-based predilections. Experiments based on a

              outperforms the state-of-the-art in reducing proximity bias (GIPE)
              by at least 42.02\%. It also reduces direct bias, adding minimal
              semantic disturbance, and achieves the best performance in a
              downstream application task (coreference resolution).",

               called computational grounded theory, which combines expert human
               knowledge and hermeneutic skills with the processing power and
               pattern recognition of computers, producing a more
               methodologically rigorous but interpretive approach to content
               analysis. The first, pattern detection step, involves inductive
               computational exploration of text, using techniques such as
               unsupervised machine learning and word scores to help researchers
               to see novel patterns in their data. The second, pattern
               refinement step, returns to an interpretive engagement with the
               data through qualitative deep reading or further exploration of
               the data. The third, pattern confirmation step, assesses the
               inductively identified patterns using further computational and
               natural language processing techniques. The result is an
               efficient, rigorous, and fully reproducible computational
               grounded theory. This framework can be applied to any qualitative
               text as data, including transcribed speeches, interviews,
               open-ended survey data, or ethnographic field notes, and can

               various aspects of a movie. Sentences in review documents contain
               independent clauses that express different sentiments toward
               different aspects of a movie. The method adopts a linguistic
               approach of computing the sentiment of a clause from the prior
               sentiment scores assigned to individual words, taking into
               consideration the grammatical dependency structure of the clause.
               The prior sentiment scores of about 32,000 individual words are
               derived from SentiWordNet with the help of a subjectivity
               lexicon. Negation is delicately handled. The output sentiment
               scores can be used to identify the most positive and negative

              are connecting human communicative spaces to automated

               their discussions exist only in the electronic medium, these
               groups can be viewed usefully as discourse communities. The
               authors draw on what is known about two other popular sources of

               the rhetorical challenges faced by members of electronic support

                 knowledge of nonexistent financial concepts, independent of
                 actual knowledge. Study 2 demonstrated that self-perceived
                 knowledge within specific domains (e.g., biology) is associated

  abstract = "This article examines the notion of genre in video games. The main
              argument is that the market-based categories of genre that have
              been developed in the context of video games obscure the new
              medium's crucial defining feature, by dividing them into
              categories (loosely) organized by their similarities to prior
              forms of mediation. The article explores the inherent tension
              between the conception of video games as a unified new media form,
              and the current fragmented genre-based approach that explicitly or
              implicitly concatenates video games with prior media forms. This
              tension reflects the current debate, within the fledgling
              discipline of Game Studies, between those who advocate narrative
              as the primary tool for understanding video games,
              ``narratologists,'' and those that oppose this notion,
              ``ludologists.'' In reference to this tension, the article argues
              that video game genres be examined in order to assess what kind of
              assumptions stem from the uncritical acceptance of genre as a
              descriptive category. Through a critical examination of the key
              game genres, this article will demonstrate how the clearly defined
              genre boundaries collapse to reveal structural similarities
              between the genres that exist within the current genre system,
              defined within the context of visual aesthetic or narrative
              structure. The inability of the current genre descriptions to
              locate and highlight these particular features suggests that to
              privilege the categories of the visual and narrative is a failure
              to understand the medium. The article concludes by suggesting that
              the tension between ``ludology'' and ``narratology'' can be more
              constructively engaged by conceptualizing video games as operating
              in the interplay between these two taxonomies of genre.",

                 Drawing on a study of the Internet usage of Australian men with
                 prostate cancer, the author investigates how access to
                 information and online support affects men's experiences of

                 The data reveal that accessing information and/or support
                 online can have a profound effect on men's experiences of
                 prostate cancer, providing a method of taking some control over

                 face-to-face encounters. However, it is also clear that some

                 pregnancy and birth are routinely told between women. However,
                 increased prenatal testing means that more fetuses are

               in heightening the campaign?s visibility. Using content analysis,
               our study demonstrates that the press contributed to expanding
               and reinforcing \#MeToo?s visibility in important ways. In terms
               of reach, the UK press has expanded the movement?s visibility
               beyond social media, addressing potentially new and different
               readerships. This attests to the pivotal role that news media
               continue to play in disseminating global issues and debates for a
               national audience. Second, in terms of content, while the news
               coverage developed and consolidated stories that were originally
               revealed on social media, it also publicized new stories.
               However, our study also highlights how the press? role in
               enabling and expanding the visibility of \#MeToo has been
               characterized by a number of crucial and, we argue, problematic
               factors. First, while \#MeToo was covered positively in all
               newspapers, there was significant variation within newspapers,
               which was largely consistent with their traditional ideological
               alignments. Second, the \#MeToo coverage seems to have followed
               and reinforced familiar patterns with respect to news coverage of
               both sexual violence and feminism, namely, support of feminism

              classification all frequently rely on computational algorithms,

              (2) opacity as technical illiteracy, and (3) an opacity that

              the scale required to apply them usefully. The analysis in this

               presented ethical challenges. As the research community works to

               Within our survey sample, few users were previously aware that
               their public tweets could be used by researchers, and the
               majority felt that researchers should not be able to use tweets

                 to define or benchmark the quality of outpatient clinical
                 documentation. Outpatient clinical notes document care,
                 communicate treatment plans and support patient safety, medical
                 education, medico-legal investigations and reimbursement.
                 Accurately describing and assessing quality of clinical
                 documentation is a necessary improvement in an increasingly
                 team-based healthcare delivery system. In this paper we
                 describe the quality of outpatient clinical notes from the
                 perspective of multiple stakeholders. METHODS: Using purposeful
                 sampling for maximum diversity, we conducted focus groups and
                 individual interviews with clinicians, nursing and ancillary
                 staff, patients, and healthcare administrators at six federal
                 health care facilities between 2009 and 2011. All sessions were
                 audio-recorded, transcribed and qualitatively analyzed using
                 open, axial and selective coding. RESULTS: The 163 participants
                 included 61 clinicians, 52 nurse/ancillary staff, 31 patients
                 and 19 administrative staff. Three organizing themes emerged:
                 1) characteristics of quality in clinical notes, 2) desired
                 elements within the clinical notes and 3) system supports to
                 improve the quality of clinical notes. We identified 11 codes
                 to describe characteristics of clinical notes, 20 codes to
                 describe desired elements in quality clinical notes and 11
                 codes to describe clinical system elements that support quality
                 when writing clinical notes. While there was substantial
                 overlap between the aspects of quality described by the four
                 stakeholder groups, only clinicians and administrators
                 identified ease of translation into billing codes as an
                 important characteristic of a quality note. Only patients rated
                 prioritization of their medical problems as an aspect of
                 quality. Nurses included care and education delivered to the
                 patient, information added by the patient, interdisciplinary
                 information, and infection alerts as important content.
                 CONCLUSIONS: Perspectives of these four stakeholder groups
                 provide a comprehensive description of quality in outpatient
                 clinical documentation. The resulting description of
                 characteristics and content necessary for quality notes
                 provides a research-based foundation for assessing the quality
                 of clinical documentation in outpatient health care settings.",

                 implications for a woman's health and wellbeing. The birth
                 experience and satisfaction with birth have been associated
                 with several factors and emotional dimensions of care and been
                 shown to influence women's overall assessment. Individualized
                 emotional support has been shown to empower women and increase
                 the possibility of a positive birth experience. How women
                 assess their experience and the factors that contribute to a
                 positive birth experience are of importance for midwives and
                 other caregivers. The aim of this study was to describe women's
                 experience of a very positive birth experience. METHOD: The
                 study followed a qualitative descriptive design. Twenty-six
                 women participated in focus group discussions 6-7 years after a
                 birth they had assessed as very positive. At the time of the
                 birth, they had all taken part in a large prospective
                 longitudinal cohort study performed in northern Sweden. In the
                 present study, thematic analysis was used to review the
                 transcribed data. RESULTS: All women looked back very
                 positively on their birth experience. Two themes and six
                 sub-themes were identified that described the meaning of a very
                 positive birth experience. Women related their experience to
                 internal (e.g., their own ability and strength) and external
                 (e.g., a trustful and respectful relationship with the midwife)
                 factors. A woman's sense of trust and support from the father
                 of the child was also important. The feeling of safety promoted
                 by a supportive environment was essential for gaining control
                 during birth and for focusing on techniques that enabled the
                 women to manage labour. CONCLUSION: It is an essential part of
                 midwifery care to build relationships with women where mutual
                 trust in one another's competence is paramount. The midwife is
                 the active guide through pregnancy and birth and should express
                 a strong belief in a woman's ability to give birth. Midwives
                 are required to inform, encourage and to provide the tools to
                 enable birth, making it important for midwives to invite the
                 partner to be part of a team, in which everyone works together
                 for the benefit of the woman and child.",

                 crucial source of knowledge about childbirth. What has not been
                 reported is the effect that birth stories may have on
                 primigravid women's understandings of birth. Findings are
                 presented from a qualitative study exploring how two
                 generations of women came to understand birth in the milieu of
                 other's stories. The prior assumption was that birth stories
                 must surely have a positive or negative influence on listeners,
                 steering them towards either medical or midwifery-led models of
                 care. METHODS: A Heideggerian hermeneutic phenomenological
                 approach was used. Twenty UK participants were purposively
                 selected and interviewed. Findings from the initial sample of
                 10 women who were pregnant in 2012 indicated that virtual media
                 was a primary source of birth stories. This led to recruitment
                 of a second sample of 10 women who gave birth in the
                 1970s-1980s, to determine whether they were more able to
                 translate information into knowledge via stories told through
                 personal contact and not through virtual technologies. RESULTS:
                 Findings revealed the experience of 'being-in-the-world' of
                 birth and of stories in that world. From a Heideggerian
                 perspective, the birth story was constructed through 'idle
                 talk' (the taken for granted assumptions of things, which come
                 into being through language). Both oral stories and those told
                 through technology were described as the 'modern birth story'.
                 The first theme 'Stories are difficult like that', examines the
                 birth story as problematic and considers how stories shape
                 meaning. The second 'It's a generational thing', considers how
                 women from two generations came to understand what their
                 experience might be. The third 'Birth in the twilight of
                 certainty,' examines women's experience of Being in a system of
                 birth as constructed, portrayed and sustained in the stories
                 being shared. CONCLUSIONS: The women pregnant in 2012 framed
                 their expectations in the language of choice, whilst the women
                 who birthed in the 1970s-1980s framed their experience in the
                 language of safety. For both, however, the world of birth was
                 the same; saturated with, and only legitimised by the birth of
                 a healthy baby. Rather than creating meaningful understanding,
                 the 'idle talk' of birth made both cohorts fearful of leaving
                 the relative comfort of the 'system', and of claiming an
                 alternative birth.",

              good publicity,'' prior research has demonstrated only downsides
              to negative press. Negative reviews or word of mouth, for example,
              have been found to hurt product evaluation and sales. Using a
              combination of econometric analysis and experimental methods, we
              unify these perspectives to delineate contexts under which
              negative ublicity about a product will have positive versus
              negative effects. Specifically, we argue that negative publicity
              can increase purchase likelihood and sales by increasing product
              awareness. Consequently, negative publicity should have
              differential effects on established versus unknown products. Three
              studies support this perspective. Whereas a negative review in the
              New York Times hurt sales of books by well- known authors, for
              example, it increased sales of books that had lower prior
              awareness. The studies further underscore the importance of a gap

              increased awareness in these effects.",

               rely on coarse cultural categories defined by researchers, and

               enculturation trajectories of employees in a midsized technology
               firm based on analyses of 10.24 million internal emails. Our
               language-based model of changing cultural fit (1) predicts

               adaptation for employees who exit voluntarily, exit

               is comprehended explicitly in words and that serves as a
               springboard into action. In this paper we take the position that
               the concept of sensemaking fills important gaps in organizational
               theory. The seemingly transient nature of sensemaking belies its
               central role in the determination of human behavior, whether
               people are acting in formal organizations or elsewhere.
               Sensemaking is central because it is the primary site where
               meanings materialize that inform and constrain identity and
               action. The purpose of this paper is to take stock of the concept
               of sensemaking. We do so by pinpointing central features of
               sensemaking, some of which have been explicated but neglected,
               some of which have been assumed but not made explicit, some of
               which have changed in significance over time, and some of which
               have been missing all along or have gone awry. We sense joint
               enthusiasm to restate sensemaking in ways that make it more
               future oriented, more action oriented, more macro, more closely
               tied to organizing, meshed more boldly with identity, more
               visible, more behaviorally defined, less sedentary and backward

                 high-functioning primary care practices, innovations we believe
                 can facilitate joy in practice and mitigate physician burnout.
                 To do so, we made site visits to 23 high-performing primary
                 care practices and focused on how these practices distribute
                 functions among the team, use technology to their advantage,
                 improve outcomes with data, and make the job of primary care
                 feasible and enjoyable as a life's vocation. Innovations
                 identified include (1) proactive planned care, with previsit
                 planning and previsit laboratory tests; (2) sharing clinical
                 care among a team, with expanded rooming protocols, standing
                 orders, and panel management; (3) sharing clerical tasks with
                 collaborative documentation (scribing), nonphysician order
                 entry, and streamlined prescription management; (4) improving
                 communication by verbal messaging and in-box management; and
                 (5) improving team functioning through co-location, team
                 meetings, and work flow mapping. Our observations suggest that
                 a shift from a physician-centric model of work distribution and
                 responsibility to a shared-care model, with a higher level of
                 clinical support staff per physician and frequent forums for
                 communication, can result in high-functioning teams, improved

  abstract    = "PURPOSE: Primary care physicians spend nearly 2 hours on
                 electronic health record (EHR) tasks per hour of direct patient
                 care. Demand for non-face-to-face care, such as communication
                 through a patient portal and administrative tasks, is
                 increasing and contributing to burnout. The goal of this study
                 was to assess time allocated by primary care physicians within
                 the EHR as indicated by EHR user-event log data, both during
                 clinic hours (defined as 8:00 am to 6:00 pm Monday through
                 Friday) and outside clinic hours. METHODS: We conducted a
                 retrospective cohort study of 142 family medicine physicians in
                 a single system in southern Wisconsin. All Epic (Epic Systems
                 Corporation) EHR interactions were captured from ``event
                 logging'' records over a 3-year period for both direct patient
                 care and non-face-to-face activities, and were validated by
                 direct observation. EHR events were assigned to 1 of 15 EHR
                 task categories and allocated to either during or after clinic
                 hours. RESULTS: Clinicians spent 355 minutes (5.9 hours) of an
                 11.4-hour workday in the EHR per weekday per 1.0 clinical
                 full-time equivalent: 269 minutes (4.5 hours) during clinic
                 hours and 86 minutes (1.4 hours) after clinic hours. Clerical
                 and administrative tasks including documentation, order entry,
                 billing and coding, and system security accounted for nearly
                 one-half of the total EHR time (157 minutes, 44.2\%). Inbox
                 management accounted for another 85 minutes (23.7\%).
                 CONCLUSIONS: Primary care physicians spend more than one-half
                 of their workday, nearly 6 hours, interacting with the EHR
                 during and after clinic hours. EHR event logs can identify
                 areas of EHR-related work that could be delegated, thus
                 reducing workload, improving professional satisfaction, and
                 decreasing burnout. Direct time-motion observations validated
                 EHR-event log data as a reliable source of information
                 regarding clinician time allocation.",

                 interpreting biomedical results cannot be underestimated.
                 Misreporting and misinterpretation are pressing problems in
                 randomized controlled trials (RCT) output. This may be
                 partially related to the statistical significance paradigm used
                 in clinical trials centered around a P value below 0.05 cutoff.
                 Strict use of this P value may lead to strategies of clinical
                 researchers to describe their clinical results with P values
                 approaching but not reaching the threshold to be ``almost
                 significant.'' The question is how phrases expressing
                 nonsignificant results have been reported in RCTs over the past
                 30 years. To this end, we conducted a quantitative analysis of
                 English full texts containing 567,758 RCTs recorded in PubMed
                 between 1990 and 2020 (81.5\% of all published RCTs in PubMed).
                 We determined the exact presence of 505 predefined phrases
                 denoting results that approach but do not cross the line of
                 formal statistical significance (P < 0.05). We modeled temporal
                 trends in phrase data with Bayesian linear regression. Evidence
                 for temporal change was obtained through Bayes factor (BF)
                 analysis. In a randomly sampled subset, the associated P values
                 were manually extracted. We identified 61,741 phrases in 49,134
                 RCTs indicating almost significant results (8.65\%; 95\%
                 confidence interval (CI): 8.58\% to 8.73\%). The overall
                 prevalence of these phrases remained stable over time, with the
                 most prevalent phrases being ``marginally significant'' (in
                 7,735 RCTs), ``all but significant'' (7,015), ``a
                 nonsignificant trend'' (3,442), ``failed to reach statistical
                 significance'' (2,578), and ``a strong trend'' (1,700). The
                 strongest evidence for an increased temporal prevalence was
                 found for ``a numerical trend,'' ``a positive trend,'' ``an
                 increasing trend,'' and ``nominally significant.'' In contrast,
                 the phrases ``all but significant,'' ``approaches statistical
                 significance,'' ``did not quite reach statistical
                 significance,'' ``difference was apparent,'' ``failed to reach
                 statistical significance,'' and ``not quite significant''
                 decreased over time. In a random sampled subset of 29,000
                 phrases, the manually identified and corresponding 11,926 P
                 values, 68,1\% ranged between 0.05 and 0.15 (CI: 67. to 69.0;
                 median 0.06). Our results show that RCT reports regularly
                 contain specific phrases describing marginally nonsignificant
                 results to report P values close to but above the dominant 0.05
                 cutoff. The fact that the prevalence of the phrases remained
                 stable over time indicates that this practice of broadly
                 interpreting P values close to a predefined threshold remains
                 prevalent. To enhance responsible and transparent
                 interpretation of RCT results, researchers, clinicians,
                 reviewers, and editors may reduce the focus on formal
                 statistical significance thresholds and stimulate reporting of
                 P values with corresponding effect sizes and CIs and focus on
                 the clinical relevance of the statistical difference found in
                 RCTs.",

                 the narrative mindset or control condition) and the observation
                 of effects. In the second part, presented as a separate study,
                 a participant was asked to advise other people facing
                 interpersonal problems (experiment 1) or emotional problems
                 (experiment 2). Three pairs of coders judged each piece of
                 advice independently on three scales: Effectivity of the
                 advice, empathy, and personalization (using their own
                 experiences in providing the advice). The results indicate that
                 the narrative mindset increases empathy, supported by the
                 co-occurring increase in the problem's personalization, which
                 leads to higher effectivity. The results reveal the positive
                 real-life implications of structuring social information within
                 a story frame. It may encourage the introduction of the
                 narrative mindset effects into an area of social cognition
                 research. Finally, the experiments show that the narrative
                 mindset may be activated experimentally, providing an effective
                 instrument to test the impact of narrative knowledge on social
                 cognition.",

  abstract    = "BACKGROUND: Negative information about vaccines that spreads
                 online may contribute to parents' vaccine hesitancy or refusal.
                 Studies have shown that false claims about vaccines that use
                 emotive personal narratives are more likely to be shared and
                 engaged with on social media than factual evidence-based public
                 health messages. The aim of this study was to explore parents'
                 views regarding the use of positive narratives to promote
                 childhood vaccination. METHODS: We identified three
                 $\sim{}$4-minute video narratives from social media that
                 counter frequent parental concerns about childhood vaccination:
                 parents and informed decision-making (online misinformation
                 about vaccines); a paediatrician's clinical experience with
                 vaccine-preventable diseases (prevention of still existing
                 diseases); and a mother's experience with vaccine-preventable
                 disease (risks of the disease). Focus group discussions were
                 held with parents of children aged 0 to 5 years to assess their
                 views on these three narratives and their general opinion on
                 the use of narratives as a vaccine promotion intervention.
                 RESULTS: Four focus groups discussions were virtually held with
                 15 parents in December 2021. In general, parents trusted both
                 health care provider's and parent's narratives, but
                 participants identified more with stories having a parent as
                 the main character. Both narratives featuring personal stories
                 with vaccine-preventable diseases were preferred by parents,
                 while the story about informed decision-making was perceived as
                 less influential. Parents expressed the need for reliable and
                 nuanced information about vaccines and diseases and felt that a
                 short video format featuring a story was an efficient vaccine
                 promotion intervention. However, many mentioned that they
                 generally are not watching such videos while navigating the
                 Web. CONCLUSION: While vaccine-critical stories are widely
                 shared online, evidence on how best public health could counter
                 these messages remains scarce. The use of narratives to promote
                 vaccination was well-perceived by parents. Future studies are
                 needed to assess reach and impact of such an intervention.",

                 delivery. This study used data captured by the access time
                 stamp functionality of an electronic health record (EHR) to
                 examine physician work effort. This is a potentially powerful,
                 yet unobtrusive, way to study physicians' use of time. We used
                 data on physicians' time allocation patterns captured by over
                 thirty-one million EHR transactions in the period 2011-14
                 recorded by 471 primary care physicians, who collectively
                 worked on 765,129 patients' EHRs. Our results suggest that the
                 physicians logged an average of 3.08 hours on office visits and
                 3.17 hours on desktop medicine each day. Desktop medicine
                 consists of activities such as communicating with patients

                 tests, sending staff messages, and reviewing test results. Over
                 time, log records from physicians showed a decline in the time
                 allocated to face-to-face visits, accompanied by an increase in
                 time allocated to desktop medicine. Staffing and scheduling in
                 the physician's office, as well as provider payment models for

               popular languages including Japanese, Portuguese, Indonesian, and
               Spanish together accounted for 39\% of the tweets. Examining
               users of the top 10 languages, we discovered cross-language

               well understood. We compare two ways for modelling suspense:
               surprise, a backward-looking measure of how unexpected the

               reduction, a forward-looking measure of how unexpected the

               directly over story representations or over their probability
               distributions. We propose a hierarchical language model that
               encodes stories and computes surprise and uncertainty reduction.
               Evaluating against short stories annotated with human suspense
               judgements, we find that uncertainty reduction over

               and recalled events. We introduce a measure of narrative flow and
               use this to examine the narratives for imagined and recalled

               knowledge attributed to semantic memory versus episodic memory
               (Tulving, 1972) for imagined and recalled storytelling by
               comparing the frequency of descriptions of general commonsense

               is that it is rarely what is stated explicitly, but rather the
               implied meanings, that frame people's judgments about others. For
               example, given a statement that ``we shouldn't lower our
               standards to hire more women,'' most listeners will infer the
               implicature intended by the speaker - that ``women (candidates)
               are less qualified.'' Most semantic formalisms, to date, do not
               capture such pragmatic implications in which people express
               social biases and power differentials in language. We introduce
               Social Bias Frames, a new conceptual formalism that aims to model
               the pragmatic frames in which people project social biases and
               stereotypes onto others. In addition, we introduce the Social
               Bias Inference Corpus to support large-scale modelling and

               posts, covering over 34k implications about a thousand

               high-level categorization of whether a given statement projects
               unwanted social bias (80\% F1), they are not effective at

               problems (e.g., cloze tests) is a natural approach for gauging

               the increased emphasis on data quantity has made it challenging
               to assess the quality of data. We introduce Data Maps---a
               model-based tool to characterize and diagnose datasets. We
               leverage a largely ignored source of information: the behavior of
               the model on individual instances during training (training
               dynamics) for building data maps. This yields two intuitive
               measures for each example---the model's confidence in the true
               class, and the variability of this confidence across
               epochs---obtained in a single run of training. Experiments on
               four datasets show that these model-dependent measures reveal
               three distinct regions in the data map, each with pronounced
               characteristics. First, our data maps show the presence of
               ``ambiguous'' regions with respect to the model, which contribute
               the most towards out-of-distribution generalization. Second, the
               most populous regions in the data are ``easy to learn'' for the
               model, and play an important role in model optimization. Finally,
               data maps uncover a region with instances that the model finds
               ``hard to learn''; these often correspond to labeling errors. Our
               results indicate that a shift in focus from quantity to quality
               of data could lead to robust models and improved

               been made towards developing storytelling machines or inferring

               introduce a corpus of real-world spoken personal narratives
               comprising 10,296 narrative clauses from 594 video transcripts.
               Second, we ask non-narrative experts to annotate those clauses

               action, orientation, and evaluation clause types) and train a

               questions can be used to get insight into people's subjective
               narratives of the future that determine their intentions.
               Analyzing such answers to open-ended questions can be done
               through Natural Language Processing techniques. Traditional topic
               models (e.g., LSA and LDA), however, often fail to do since they
               rely on co-occurrences, which are often rare in short survey
               responses. The aim of this study was to apply and evaluate topic
               models on demographic survey data. In this study, we applied

               coherence of terms (words/phrases) based on their collocations
               across different documents, and (ii) a supervised discriminative

               variants of topic models on this task. While fairly successful,
               these methods usually do not produce highly coherent aspects. In
               this paper, we present a novel neural approach with the aim of
               discovering coherent aspects. The model improves coherence by
               exploiting the distribution of word co-occurrences through the
               use of neural word embeddings. Unlike topic models which
               typically assume independently generated words, word embedding
               models encourage words that appear in similar contexts to be
               located close to each other in the embedding space. In addition,
               we use an attention mechanism to de-emphasize irrelevant words
               during training, further improving the coherence of aspects.
               Experimental results on real-life datasets demonstrate that our
               approach discovers more meaningful and coherent aspects, and
               substantially outperforms baseline methods on several evaluation

  title    = "{Moral Crumple Zones: Cautionary Tales in Human-Robot Interaction}",
  author   = "Elish, M C",
  journal  = "We Robot",
  pages    = "1--23",
  abstract = "A prevailing rhetoric in human-robot interaction is that automated
              systems will help humans do their jobs better. Robots will not
              replace humans, but rather work alongside and supplement human
              work. Even when most of a system will be automated, the concept of
              keeping a ``human in the loop'' assures that human judgment will
              always be able to trump automation. This rhetoric emphasizes fluid
              cooperation and shared control. In practice, the dynamics of
              shared control between human and robot are more complicated,
              especially with respect to issues of accountability.As control has
              become distributed across multiple actors, our social and legal
              conceptions of responsibility remain generally about an
              individual. If there's an accident, we intuitively -- and our
              laws, in practice -- want someone to take the blame. The result of
              this ambiguity is that humans may emerge as ``moral crumple
              zones.'' Just as the crumple zone in a car is designed to absorb
              the force of impact in a crash, the human in a robotic system may
              become simply a component -- accidentally or intentionally -- that
              is intended to bear the brunt of the moral and legal penalties
              when the overall system fails.This paper employs the concept of
              ``moral crumple zones'' within human-machine systems as a lens
              through which to think about the limitations of current frameworks
              for accountability in human-machine or robot systems. The paper
              examines two historical cases of ``moral crumple zones'' in the
              fields of aviation and nuclear energy and articulates the
              dimensions of distributed control at stake while also mapping the
              degree to which this control of and responsibility for an action
              are proportionate. The argument suggests that an analysis of the
              dimensions of accountability in automated and robotic systems must
              contend with how and why accountability may be misapplied and how
              structural conditions enable this misunderstanding. How do
              non-human actors in a system effectively deflect accountability
              onto other human actors? And how might future models of robotic
              accountability require this deflection to be controlled? At stake
              is the potential ultimately to protect against new forms of
              consumer and worker harm.This paper presents the concept of the
              ``moral crumple zone'' as both a challenge to and an opportunity
              for the design and regulation of human-robot systems. By
              articulating mismatches between control and responsibility, we
              argue for an updated framework of accountability in human-robot
              systems, one that can contend with the complicated dimensions of
              cooperation between human and robot.",

                 patient) to a scribe system (15 minute follow-up and 30 minute
                 new patient) in a cardiology clinic. Physician productivity,
                 patient satisfaction, physician-patient interaction, and
                 revenue were measured. RESULTS: Four physicians saw 129
                 patients using standard care and 210 patients with scribes
                 during 65 clinic hours each. Patients seen per hour increased
                 (P < 0.001) from 2.2 $\pm{}$ 0.3 to 3.5 $\pm{}$ 0.4 (59\%
                 increase) and work relative value units (wRVU) per hour
                 increased (P < 0.001) from 3.5 $\pm{}$ 1.3 to 5.5 $\pm{}$ 1.3
                 (57\% increase). Patient satisfaction was high at baseline and
                 unchanged with scribes. In a substudy, direct patient contact
                 time was lower (9.1 $\pm{}$ 2.0 versus 12.9 $\pm{}$ 3.4
                 minutes; P < 0.01) for scribe visits, but time of patient
                 interaction (without computer) was greater (6.7 $\pm{}$ 2.1
                 versus 1.5 $\pm{}$ 1.9 minutes; P < 0.01). Subjective
                 assessment of physician-patient interaction (1-10) was higher
                 (P < 0.01) on scribe visits (9.1 $\pm{}$ 0.9 versus 7.9 $\pm{}$
                 1.1). Direct and indirect (downstream) revenue per patient seen
                 was $142 and $2,398, with \$205,740 additional revenue
                 generated from the 81 additional patients seen with scribes.
                 CONCLUSION: Using scribes in a cardiology clinic is feasible,
                 produces improvements in physician-patient interaction, and
                 results in large increases in physician productivity and system
                 cardiovascular revenue.",

                 stillbirth in the United Kingdom, their memory making and
                 sharing opportunities, and the effect these opportunities had
                 on them. Qualitative data were generated from free text
                 responses to open-ended questions. Thematic content analysis
                 revealed that ``stigma'' was experienced by most women and
                 Goffman's (1963) work on stigma was subsequently used as an
                 analytical framework. Results suggest that stillbirth can spoil
                 the identities of ``patient,'' ``mother,'' and ``full
                 citizen.'' Stigma was reported as arising from interactions
                 with professionals, family, friends, work colleagues, and even
                 casual acquaintances. Stillbirth produces common learning
                 experiences often requiring ``identity work'' (Murphy, 2012).
                 Memory making and sharing may be important in this work and
                 further research is needed. Stigma can reduce the memory
                 sharing opportunities for women after stillbirth and this may
                 explain some of the differential mental health effects of
                 memory making after stillbirth that is documented in the
                 literature.",

                 media activity, where users connect, collaborate, and engage,
                 has increased the significance of analyzing how people use
                 health-related social media. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study
                 was to classify the content (eg, posts that share experiences
                 and seek support) of users who write health-related social
                 media posts and study the effect of user demographics on post
                 content. METHODS: We analyzed two different types of
                 health-related social media: (1) health-related online
                 forums-WebMD and DailyStrength-and (2) general online social
                 networks-Twitter and Google+. We identified several categories
                 of post content and built classifiers to automatically detect
                 these categories. These classifiers were used to study the
                 distribution of categories for various demographic groups.
                 RESULTS: We achieved an accuracy of at least 84\% and a
                 balanced accuracy of at least 0.81 for half of the post content
                 categories in our experiments. In addition, 70.04\% (4741/6769)
                 of posts by male WebMD users asked for advice, and male users'
                 WebMD posts were more likely to ask for medical advice than
                 female users' posts. The majority of posts on DailyStrength
                 shared experiences, regardless of the gender, age group, or
                 location of their authors. Furthermore, health-related posts on
                 Twitter and Google+ were used to share experiences less
                 frequently than posts on WebMD and DailyStrength. CONCLUSIONS:
                 We studied and analyzed the content of health-related social
                 media posts. Our results can guide health advocates and
                 researchers to better target patient populations based on the
                 application type. Given a research question or an outreach
                 goal, our results can be used to choose the best online forums

  abstract    = "BACKGROUND: The use of online resources has changed how people
                 manage health care processes. Patients seek information about
                 health conditions, guidance in treatment, and support from
                 peers online, complementary to traditional health care
                 trajectories. Online communities have the potential to
                 contribute to the quality of care by increasing patient
                 empowerment; however, there is a gap in research regarding in
                 what way online communities contribute to patient empowerment.
                 OBJECTIVE: We synthesized research regarding how online
                 communities contribute to patient empowerment to address the
                 research question ``In what ways can participation in online
                 communities support patient empowerment?'' by studying how
                 patient empowerment is operationalized in different studies.
                 The definition of patient empowerment used in this paper is
                 enablement for people to develop mastery over actions and
                 control over decisions that influence their lives. The mastery
                 is both through processes and outcomes of the development.
                 METHODS: A systematic review was conducted by searching in the
                 following databases: Scopus, ACM Digital Library, EBSCO (CINAHL
                 and MEDLINE), PubMed, and Web of Science. In total, there were
                 1187 papers after excluding duplicates, and through selection
                 processes using an analytical framework with definitions of
                 patient empowerment and related concepts, 33 peer-reviewed
                 papers were included. RESULTS: Findings indicated that online
                 communities support patient empowerment both as a process and
                 as outcomes of these processes. Additionally, it was seen as a
                 complement to traditional health care and encouragement for
                 health care professionals to have a more positive attitude
                 toward patients' usage. There was a mix between deductive
                 (19/33, 58\%), inductive (11/33, 33\%), and a mixed approach
                 (3/33, 9\%) of studying patient empowerment in various forms.
                 The online communities in most papers (21/33, 64\%) were
                 well-established and represented patients' initiatives.
                 CONCLUSIONS: There is a need to include professionals'
                 perspectives regarding how health care can embrace patient
                 empowerment through online communities. This systematic
                 review's main contribution is the proposal of a new framework
                 and conceptualization of how patient empowerment in online
                 communities can be understood from different hierarchical
                 levels.",

                 sharing longitudinal streams of health records and personal
                 sensing data between multiple projects and researchers.
                 Motivated by the prospect of personalizing patient care
                 (precision medicine), these initiatives demand broad public
                 acceptance and large numbers of data contributors, both of
                 which are challenging. OBJECTIVE: This study investigates
                 public attitudes toward possibly contributing to digital health
                 research repositories to identify factors for their acceptance
                 and to inform future developments. METHODS: A cross-sectional
                 online survey was conducted from March 2020 to December 2020.
                 Because of the funded project scope and a multicenter
                 collaboration, study recruitment targeted young adults in
                 Denmark and Brazil, allowing an analysis of the differences
                 between 2 very contrasting national contexts. Through
                 closed-ended questions, the survey examined participants'
                 willingness to share different data types, data access
                 preferences, reasons for concern, and motivations to
                 contribute. The survey also collected information about
                 participants' demographics, level of interest in health topics,
                 previous participation in health research, awareness of
                 examples of existing research data repositories, and current
                 attitudes about digital health research repositories. Data
                 analysis consisted of descriptive frequency measures and
                 statistical inferences (bivariate associations and logistic
                 regressions). RESULTS: The sample comprises 1017 respondents
                 living in Brazil (1017/1600, 63.56\%) and 583 in Denmark
                 (583/1600, 36.44\%). The demographics do not differ
                 substantially between participants of these countries. The
                 majority is aged between 18 and 27 years (933/1600, 58.31\%),
                 is highly educated (992/1600, 62.00\%), uses smartphones
                 (1562/1600, 97.63\%), and is in good health (1407/1600,
                 87.94\%). The analysis shows a vast majority were very
                 motivated by helping future patients (1366/1600, 85.38\%) and
                 researchers (1253/1600, 78.31\%), yet very concerned about
                 unethical projects (1219/1600, 76.19\%), profit making without
                 consent (1096/1600, 68.50\%), and cyberattacks (1055/1600,
                 65.94\%). Participants' willingness to share data is lower when
                 sharing personal sensing data, such as the content of calls and
                 texts (1206/1600, 75.38\%), in contrast to more traditional
                 health research information. Only 13.44\% (215/1600) find it
                 desirable to grant data access to private companies, and most
                 would like to stay informed about which projects use their data
                 (1334/1600, 83.38\%) and control future data access (1181/1600,
                 73.81\%). Findings indicate that favorable attitudes toward
                 digital health research repositories are related to a personal
                 interest in health topics (odds ratio [OR] 1.49, 95\% CI
                 1.10-2.02; P=.01), previous participation in health research
                 studies (OR 1.70, 95\% CI 1.24-2.35; P=.001), and awareness of
                 examples of research repositories (OR 2.78, 95\% CI 1.83-4.38;
                 P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: This study reveals essential factors for
                 acceptance and willingness to share personal data with digital
                 health research repositories. Implications include the
                 importance of being more transparent about the goals and
                 beneficiaries of research projects using and re-using data from
                 repositories, providing participants with greater autonomy for
                 choosing who gets access to which parts of their data, and
                 raising public awareness of the benefits of data sharing for
                 research. In addition, future developments should engage with
                 and reduce risks for those unwilling to participate.",

  abstract    = "BACKGROUND: Social networking site use is increasingly common
                 among emerging medical professionals, with medical schools even
                 reporting disciplinary student expulsion. Medical professionals
                 who use social networking sites have unique responsibilities
                 since their postings could violate patient privacy. However, it
                 is unknown whether students and residents portray protected
                 health information and under what circumstances or contexts.
                 OBJECTIVE: The objective of our study was to document and
                 describe online portrayals of potential patient privacy
                 violations in the Facebook profiles of medical students and
                 residents. METHODS: A multidisciplinary team performed two
                 cross-sectional analyses at the University of Florida in 2007
                 and 2009 of all medical students and residents to see who had
                 Facebook profiles. For each identified profile, we manually
                 scanned the entire profile for any textual or photographic
                 representations of protected health information, such as
                 portrayals of people, names, dates, or descriptions of
                 procedures. RESULTS: Almost half of all eligible students and
                 residents had Facebook profiles (49.8\%, or n=1023 out of
                 2053). There were 12 instances of potential patient violations,
                 in which students and residents posted photographs of care they
                 provided to individuals. No resident or student posted any
                 identifiable patient information or likeness in text form. Each
                 instance occurred in developing countries on apparent medical
                 mission trips. These portrayals increased over time (1 in the
                 2007 cohort; 11 in 2009; P = .03). Medical students were more
                 likely to have these potential violations on their profiles
                 than residents (11 vs 1, P = .04), and there was no difference
                 by gender. Photographs included trainees interacting with
                 identifiable patients, all children, or performing medical
                 examinations or procedures such as vaccinations of children.
                 CONCLUSIONS: While students and residents in this study are
                 posting photographs that are potentially violations of patient
                 privacy, they only seem to make this lapse in the setting of
                 medical mission trips. Trainees need to learn to equate
                 standards of patient privacy in all medical contexts using both
                 legal and ethical arguments to maintain the highest
                 professional principles. We propose three practical guidelines.
                 First, there should be a legal resource for physicians
                 traveling on medical mission trips such as an online list of
                 local laws, or a telephone legal contact. Second, institutions
                 that organize medical mission trips should plan an ethics
                 seminar prior the departure on any trip since the legal and
                 ethical implications may not be intuitive. Finally, at minimum,
                 traveling physicians should apply the strictest legal precedent
                 to any situation.",

  abstract = "Background: The prenatal care visit structure has changed little
              over the past century despite the rapid evolution of technology
              including Internet and mobile phones. Little is known about how
              pregnant women engage with technologies and the interface between
              these tools and medical care, especially for women of lower
              socioeconomic status. Objective: We sought to understand how women
              use technology during pregnancy through a qualitative study with
              women enrolled in the Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) program.
              Methods: We recruited pregnant women ages 18 and older who owned a
              smartphone, at a WIC clinic in central Pennsylvania. The focus
              group guide included questions about women's current pregnancy,
              their sources of information, and whether they used technology for
              pregnancy-related information. Sessions were audiotaped and
              transcribed. Three members of the research team independently
              analyzed each transcript, using a thematic analysis approach.
              Themes related to the topics discussed were identified, for which
              there was full agreement. Results: Four focus groups were
              conducted with a total of 17 women. Three major themes emerged as
              follows. First, the prenatal visit structure is not
              patient-centered, with the first visit perceived as occurring too
              late and with too few visits early in pregnancy when women have
              the most questions for their prenatal care providers.
              Unfortunately, the educational materials women received during
              prenatal care were viewed as unhelpful. Second, women turn to
              technology (eg, Google, smartphone applications) to fill their
              knowledge gaps. Turning to technology was viewed to be a
              generational approach. Finally, women reported that technology,
              although frequently used, has limitations. Conclusions: The
              results of this qualitative research suggest that the current
              prenatal care visit structure is not patient-centered in that it
              does not allow women to seek advice when they want it most. A
              generational shift seems to have occurred, resulting in pregnant
              women in our study turning to the Internet and smartphones to fill
              this gap, which requires significant skills to navigate for useful
              information. Future steps may include developing interventions to
              help health care providers assist patients early in pregnancy to
              seek the information they want and to become better consumers of
              Internet-based pregnancy resources.",

  abstract    = "BACKGROUND: Although many people with serious diseases
                 participate in online support communities, little research has
                 investigated how participants elicit and provide social support
                 on these sites. OBJECTIVE: The first goal was to propose and
                 test a model of the dynamic process through which participants
                 in online support communities elicit and provide emotional and
                 informational support. The second was to demonstrate the value
                 of computer coding of conversational data using machine
                 learning techniques (1) by replicating results derived from
                 human-coded data about how people elicit support and (2) by
                 answering questions that are intractable with small samples of
                 human-coded data, namely how exposure to different types of
                 social support predicts continued participation in online
                 support communities. The third was to provide a detailed
                 description of these machine learning techniques to enable
                 other researchers to perform large-scale data analysis in these
                 communities. METHODS: Communication among approximately 90,000
                 registered users of an online cancer support community was
                 analyzed. The corpus comprised 1,562,459 messages organized
                 into 68,158 discussion threads. Amazon Mechanical Turk workers
                 coded (1) 1000 thread-starting messages on 5 attributes
                 (positive and negative emotional self-disclosure, positive and
                 negative informational self-disclosure, questions) and (2) 1000
                 replies on emotional and informational support. Their judgments
                 were used to train machine learning models that automatically
                 estimated the amount of these 7 attributes in the messages.
                 Across attributes, the average Pearson correlation between
                 human-based judgments and computer-based judgments was .65.
                 RESULTS: Part 1 used human-coded data to investigate
                 relationships between (1) 4 kinds of self-disclosure and
                 question asking in thread-starting posts and (2) the amount of
                 emotional and informational support in the first reply.
                 Self-disclosure about negative emotions (beta=.24, P<.001),
                 negative events (beta=.25, P<.001), and positive events
                 (beta=.10, P=.02) increased emotional support. However, asking
                 questions depressed emotional support (beta=-.21, P<.001). In
                 contrast, asking questions increased informational support
                 (beta=.38, P<.001), whereas positive informational
                 self-disclosure depressed it (beta=-.09, P=.003).
                 Self-disclosure led to the perception of emotional needs, which
                 elicited emotional support, whereas asking questions led to the
                 perception of informational needs, which elicited informational
                 support. Part 2 used machine-coded data to replicate these
                 results. Part 3 analyzed the machine-coded data and showed that
                 exposure to more emotional support predicted staying in the
                 group longer 33\% (hazard ratio=0.67, P<.001), whereas exposure
                 to more informational support predicted leaving the group
                 sooner (hazard ratio=1.05, P<.001). CONCLUSIONS:
                 Self-disclosure is effective in eliciting emotional support,
                 whereas question asking is effective in eliciting informational
                 support. Moreover, perceptions that people desire particular
                 kinds of support influence the support they receive. Finally,
                 the type of support people receive affects the likelihood of
                 their staying in or leaving the group. These results
                 demonstrate the utility of machine learning methods for
                 investigating the dynamics of social support exchange in online
                 support communities.",

                 contribute to online health communities (OHCs) is useful
                 knowledge in multiple domains. It is helpful for community
                 managers in developing strategies for building community, for
                 organizations in disseminating information about health
                 interventions, and for researchers in understanding the social
                 dynamics of peer support. OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine if
                 any patterns were apparent in the nature of user participation
                 across online health communities. METHODS: The current study
                 involved a systematic review of all studies that have
                 investigated the nature of participation in an online health
                 community and have provided a quantifiable method for
                 categorizing a person based on their participation style. A
                 systematic search yielded 20 papers. RESULTS: Participatory
                 styles were classified as either multidimensional (based on
                 multiple metrics) or unidimensional (based on one metric). With
                 respect to the multidimensional category, a total of 41
                 different participation styles were identified ranging from
                 Influential Users who were leaders on the board to
                 Topic-Focused Responders who focused on a specific topic and
                 tended to respond to rather than initiate posts. However, there
                 was little overlap in participation styles identified both
                 across OHCs for different health conditions and within OHCs for
                 specific health conditions. Five of the 41 styles emerged in
                 more than one study (Hubs, Authorities, Facilitators, Prime
                 Givers, and Discussants), but the remainder were reported in
                 only one study. The focus of the unidimensional studies was on
                 level of engagement and particularly on high-engaged users.
                 Eight different metrics were used to evaluate level of
                 engagement with the greatest focus on frequency of posts.
                 CONCLUSIONS: With the exception of high-engaged users based on
                 high post frequency, the current review found little evidence
                 for consistent participatory styles across different health
                 communities. However, this area of research is in its infancy,
                 with most of the studies included in the review being published
                 in the last 2 years. Nevertheless, the review delivers a
                 nomenclature for OHC participation styles and metrics and
                 discusses important methodological issues that will provide a
                 basis for future comparative research in the area. Further
                 studies are required to systematically investigate a range of
                 participatory styles, to investigate their association with
                 different types of online health communities and to determine
                 the contribution of different participatory styles within and
                 across online health communities.",

                 increasingly popular among patients, concerns have been raised
                 about the impact of patients' Internet health
                 information-seeking behavior on their relationship with
                 physicians. Therefore, it is pertinent to understand the
                 influence of online health information on the patient-physician
                 relationship. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to systematically
                 review existing research on patients' Internet health
                 information seeking and its influence on the patient-physician
                 relationship. METHODS: We systematically searched PubMed and
                 key medical informatics, information systems, and communication
                 science journals covering the period of 2000 to 2015. Empirical
                 articles that were in English were included. We analyzed the
                 content covering themes in 2 broad categories: factors
                 affecting patients' discussion of online findings during
                 consultations and implications for the patient-physician
                 relationship. RESULTS: We identified 18 articles that met the
                 inclusion criteria and the quality requirement for the review.
                 The articles revealed barriers, facilitators, and demographic
                 factors that influence patients' disclosure of online health
                 information during consultations and the different mechanisms
                 patients use to reveal these findings. Our review also showed
                 the mechanisms in which online information could influence
                 patients' relationship with their physicians. CONCLUSIONS:
                 Results of this review contribute to the understanding of the
                 patient-physician relationship of Internet-informed patients.
                 Our main findings show that Internet health information seeking
                 can improve the patient-physician relationship depending on
                 whether the patient discusses the information with the
                 physician and on their prior relationship. As patients have

                 major source of social support for people with health problems.
                 Members of OHCs interact online with similar peers to seek,
                 receive, and provide different types of social support, such as
                 informational support, emotional support, and companionship. As
                 active participations in an OHC are beneficial to both the OHC
                 and its users, it is important to understand factors related to
                 users' participations and predict user churn for user retention
                 efforts. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to analyze OHC users'
                 Web-based interactions, reveal which types of social support
                 activities are related to users' participation, and predict
                 whether and when a user will churn from the OHC. METHODS: We
                 collected a large-scale dataset from a popular OHC for cancer
                 survivors. We used text mining techniques to decide what kinds
                 of social support each post contained. We illustrated how we
                 built text classifiers for 5 different social support
                 categories: seeking informational support (SIS), providing
                 informational support (PIS), seeking emotional support (SES),
                 providing emotional support (PES), and companionship (COM). We
                 conducted survival analysis to identify types of social support
                 related to users' continued participation. Using supervised
                 machine learning methods, we developed a predictive model for
                 user churn. RESULTS: Users' behaviors to PIS, SES, and COM had
                 hazard ratios significantly lower than 1 (0.948, 0.972, and
                 0.919, respectively) and were indicative of continued
                 participations in the OHC. The churn prediction model based on
                 social support activities offers accurate predictions on
                 whether and when a user will leave the OHC. CONCLUSIONS:
                 Detecting different types of social support activities via text
                 mining contributes to better understanding and prediction of
                 users' participations in an OHC. The outcome of this study can
                 help the management and design of a sustainable OHC via more
                 proactive and effective user retention strategies.",

  abstract    = "BACKGROUND: Although primarily used for social networking and
                 often used for social support and dissemination, data on social
                 media platforms are increasingly being used to facilitate
                 research. However, the ethical challenges in conducting social
                 media research remain of great concern. Although much debated
                 in the literature, it is the views of the public that are most
                 pertinent to inform future practice. OBJECTIVE: The aim of our
                 study was to ascertain attitudes on the ethical considerations
                 of using social media as a data source for research as
                 expressed by social media users and researchers. METHODS: A
                 systematic review was conducted, wherein 16 databases and 2
                 Internet search engines were searched in addition to
                 handsearching, reference checking, citation searching, and
                 contacting authors and experts. Studies that conducted any
                 qualitative methods to collect data on attitudes on the ethical
                 implications of research using social media were included.
                 Quality assessment was conducted using the quality of reporting
                 tool (QuaRT) and findings analyzed using inductive thematic
                 synthesis. RESULTS: In total, 17 studies met the inclusion
                 criteria. Attitudes varied from overly positive with people
                 expressing the views about the essential nature of such
                 research for the public good, to very concerned with views that
                 social media research should not happen. Underlying reasons for
                 this variation related to issues such as the purpose and
                 quality of the research, the researcher affiliation, and the
                 potential harms. The methods used to conduct the research were
                 also important. Many respondents were positive about social
                 media research while adding caveats such as the need for
                 informed consent or use restricted to public platforms only.
                 CONCLUSIONS: Many conflicting issues contribute to the
                 complexity of good ethical practice in social media research.
                 However, this should not deter researchers from conducting
                 social media research. Each Internet research project requires
                 an individual assessment of its own ethical issues. Guidelines
                 on ethical conduct should be based on current evidence and
                 standardized to avoid discrepancies between, and duplication
                 across, different institutions, taking into consideration
                 different jurisdictions.",

  abstract    = "BACKGROUND: As a response to the criticisms evidence-based
                 practice currently faces, groups of health care researchers and
                 guideline makers have started to call for the appraisal and
                 inclusion of different kinds of knowledge in guideline
                 production (other than randomized controlled trials [RCTs]) to
                 better link with the informal knowledge used in clinical
                 practice. In an ethnographic study, Gabbay and Le May showed
                 that clinicians in everyday practice situations do not
                 explicitly or consciously use guidelines. Instead, they use
                 mindlines: collectively shared, mostly tacit knowledge that is
                 shaped by many sources, including accumulated personal
                 experiences, education (formal and informal), guidance, and the
                 narratives about patients that are shared among colleagues. In
                 this study on informal knowledge, we consider virtual networks
                 of clinicians as representative of the mindlines in the wider
                 medical community, as holders of knowledge, as well as
                 catalysts of knowing. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to
                 explore how informal knowledge and its creation in communities
                 of clinicians can be characterized as opposed to the more
                 structured knowledge produced in guideline development.
                 METHODS: This study included a qualitative study of postings on
                 three large virtual networks for physicians in the United
                 Kingdom, the Netherlands, and Norway, taking the topic of
                 statins as a case study and covering more than 1400 posts. Data
                 were analyzed thematically with reference to theories of
                 collaborative knowledge construction and communities of
                 practice. RESULTS: The dataset showed very few postings
                 referring to, or seeking to adhere to, explicit guidance and
                 recommendations. Participants presented many instances of
                 individual case narratives that highlighted quantitative test
                 results and clinical examination findings. There was an
                 emphasis on outliers and the material, regulatory, and
                 practical constraints on knowledge use by clinicians.
                 Participants conveyed not-so-explicit knowledge as tacit and
                 practical knowledge and used a prevailing style of pragmatic
                 reasoning focusing on what was likely to work in a particular
                 case. Throughout the discussions, a collective
                 conceptualization of statins was generated and reinforced in
                 many contexts through stories, jokes, and imagery. CONCLUSIONS:
                 Informal knowledge and knowing in clinical communities entail
                 an inherently collective dynamic practice that includes
                 explicit and nonexplicit components. It can be characterized as
                 knowledge-in-context in practice, with a strong focus on
                 casuistry. Validity of knowledge appears not to be based on
                 criteria of consensus, coherence, or correspondence but on a
                 more polyphonic understanding of truth. We contend that our
                 findings give enough ground for further research on how
                 exploring mindlines of clinicians online could help improve
                 guideline development processes.",

                 reduce health care utilization by people with long-term
                 conditions. Online communities for people with long-term
                 conditions have the potential to influence health, usage of
                 health care resources, and facilitate illness self-management.
                 Only recently, however, has evidence been reported on how such
                 communities function and evolve, and how they support
                 self-management of long-term conditions in practice. OBJECTIVE:
                 The aim of this study is to gain a better understanding of the
                 mechanisms underlying online self-management support systems by
                 analyzing the structure and dynamics of the networks connecting
                 users who write posts over time. METHODS: We conducted a
                 longitudinal network analysis of anonymized data from 2
                 patients' online communities from the United Kingdom: the
                 Asthma UK and the British Lung Foundation (BLF) communities in
                 2006-2016 and 2012-2016, respectively. RESULTS: The number of
                 users and activity grew steadily over time, reaching 3345 users
                 and 32,780 posts in the Asthma UK community, and 19,837 users
                 and 875,151 posts in the BLF community. People who wrote posts
                 in the Asthma UK forum tended to write at an interval of 1-20
                 days and six months, while those in the BLF community wrote at
                 an interval of two days. In both communities, most pairs of
                 users could reach one another either directly or indirectly
                 through other users. Those who wrote a disproportionally large
                 number of posts (the superusers) represented 1\% of the overall
                 population of both Asthma UK and BLF communities and accounted
                 for 32\% and 49\% of the posts, respectively. Sensitivity
                 analysis showed that the removal of superusers would cause the
                 communities to collapse. Thus, interactions were held together
                 by very few superusers, who posted frequently and regularly,
                 65\% of them at least every 1.7 days in the BLF community and
                 70\% every 3.1 days in the Asthma UK community. Their posting
                 activity indirectly facilitated tie formation between other
                 users. Superusers were a constantly available resource, with a
                 mean of 80 and 20 superusers active at any one time in the BLF
                 and Asthma UK communities, respectively. Over time, the more
                 active users became, the more likely they were to reply to
                 other users' posts rather than to write new ones, shifting from
                 a help-seeking to a help-giving role. This might suggest that
                 superusers were more likely to provide than to seek advice.
                 CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we uncover key structural
                 properties related to the way users interact and sustain online
                 health communities. Superusers' engagement plays a fundamental
                 sustaining role and deserves research attention. Further
                 studies are needed to explore network determinants of the
                 effectiveness of online engagement concerning health-related
                 outcomes. In resource-constrained health care systems, scaling
                 up online communities may offer a potentially accessible,
                 wide-reaching and cost-effective intervention facilitating
                 greater levels of self-management.",

  abstract  = "Background: Online communities provide affordable venues for
               behavior change. However, active user engagement holds the key to
               the success of these platforms. In order to enhance user
               engagement and in turn, health outcomes, it is essential to offer
               targeted interventional and informational support. Objective: In
               this paper, we describe a content plus frequency framework to
               enable the characterization of highly engaged users in online
               communities and study theoretical techniques employed by these
               users through analysis of exchanged communication. Methods: We
               applied the proposed methodology for analysis of peer
               interactions within QuitNet, an online community for smoking
               cessation. Firstly, we identified 144 highly engaged users based
               on communication frequency within QuitNet over a period of 16
               years. Secondly, we used the taxonomy of behavior change
               techniques, text analysis methods from distributional semantics,
               machine learning, and sentiment analysis to assign theory-driven
               labels to content. Finally, we extracted content-specific
               insights from peer interactions (n=159,483 messages) among highly
               engaged QuitNet users. Results: Studying user engagement using
               our proposed framework led to the definition of 3 user
               categories--conversation initiators, conversation attractors, and
               frequent posters. Specific behavior change techniques employed by
               top tier users (threshold set at top 3) within these 3 user
               groups were found to be goal setting, social support, rewards and
               threat, and comparison of outcomes. Engagement-specific trends
               within sentiment manifestations were also identified.
               Conclusions: Use of content-inclusive analytics has offered deep
               insight into specific behavior change techniques employed by
               highly engaged users within QuitNet. Implications for
               personalization and active user engagement are discussed. [J

  abstract    = "BACKGROUND: Social media offer an unprecedented opportunity to
                 explore how people talk about health care at a very large
                 scale. Numerous studies have shown the importance of websites
                 with user forums for people seeking information related to
                 health. Parents turn to some of these sites, colloquially
                 referred to as ``mommy blogs,'' to share concerns about
                 children's health care, including vaccination. Although
                 substantial work has considered the role of social media,
                 particularly Twitter, in discussions of vaccination and other
                 health care-related issues, there has been little work on
                 describing the underlying structure of these discussions and
                 the role of persuasive storytelling, particularly on sites with
                 no limits on post length. Understanding the role of persuasive
                 storytelling at Internet scale provides useful insight into how
                 people discuss vaccinations, including exemption-seeking
                 behavior, which has been tied to a recent diminution of herd
                 immunity in some communities. OBJECTIVE: To develop an
                 automated and scalable machine-learning method for story
                 aggregation on social media sites dedicated to discussions of
                 parenting. We wanted to discover the aggregate narrative
                 frameworks to which individuals, through their exchange of
                 experiences and commentary, contribute over time in a
                 particular topic domain. We also wanted to characterize
                 temporal trends in these narrative frameworks on the sites over
                 the study period. METHODS: To ensure that our data capture
                 long-term discussions and not short-term reactions to recent
                 events, we developed a dataset of 1.99 million posts
                 contributed by 40,056 users and viewed 20.12 million times
                 indexed from 2 parenting sites over a period of 105 months.
                 Using probabilistic methods, we determined the topics of
                 discussion on these parenting sites. We developed a generative
                 statistical-mechanical narrative model to automatically extract
                 the underlying stories and story fragments from millions of
                 posts. We aggregated the stories into an overarching narrative
                 framework graph. In our model, stories were represented as
                 network graphs with actants as nodes and their various
                 relationships as edges. We estimated the latent stories
                 circulating on these sites by modeling the posts as a sampling
                 of the hidden narrative framework graph. Temporal trends were
                 examined based on monthly user-poststatistics. RESULTS: We
                 discovered that discussions of exemption from vaccination
                 requirements are highly represented. We found a strong
                 narrative framework related to exemption seeking and a culture
                 of distrust of government and medical institutions. Various
                 posts reinforced part of the narrative framework graph in which
                 parents, medical professionals, and religious institutions
                 emerged as key nodes, and exemption seeking emerged as an
                 important edge. In the aggregate story, parents used religion
                 or belief to acquire exemptions to protect their children from
                 vaccines that are required by schools or government
                 institutions, but (allegedly) cause adverse reactions such as
                 autism, pain, compromised immunity, and even death. Although
                 parents joined and left the discussion forums over time,
                 discussions and stories about exemptions were persistent and
                 robust to these membership changes. CONCLUSIONS: Analyzing
                 parent forums about health care using an automated analytic
                 approach, such as the one presented here, allows the detection
                 of widespread narrative frameworks that structure and inform
                 discussions. In most vaccination stories from the sites we
                 analyzed, it is taken for granted that vaccines and not vaccine
                 preventable diseases (VPDs) pose a threat to children. Because
                 vaccines are seen as a threat, parents focus on sharing
                 successful strategies for avoiding them, with exemption being
                 the foremost among these strategies. When new parents join such
                 sites, they may be exposed to this endemic narrative framework
                 in the threads they read and to which they contribute, which
                 may influence their health care decision making.",

               seeable and sayable: what ``ideas,'' as Neil Postman once put it,
               ``we can conveniently express.'' In this essay, I ask what one of
               today's major new media forms--viral, digital
               ``content''--compels us to see and say. To address that question,
               I em-brace a makeshift, hybrid methodology, informed by theory,
               sociology, arts criticism, and the digital humanities, and
               eschewing media theoretical orthodoxies that have been dominant
               across the humanities (namely: an exaggerated emphasis on the
               ``medium'' at the expense of the ``message''). From this
               poly-glot perspective, I analyze content contained in a database
               that I have compiled, indexing 205,147 of the most-shared pieces
               of viral media on sites like Facebook and Twitter, from 2014 to
               2019. After survey-ing this content's basic features, I focus on
               one, particularly popular and quintessential content genre, which
               I call the ``uplifting anecdote'': a short, sentimental account
               of a heroic act. The uplifting anec-dote, I argue, promotes a
               novel type of ethics, ideally suited to the content economy. I
               then track this ethics' dissemination into the broader culture,
               through a discussion of two prominent, aesthetic artifacts:
               George Saunders' prize-winning, best-selling novel, Lincoln in

               debate ``classic'' literature by computa-tionally analyzing and
               close reading more than 120,000 user reviews. We begin by
               exploring how crowdsourced tagging systems like those found on
               Goodreads have influenced the evolution of genre among readers
               and amateur critics, and we highlight the contemporary value of
               the ``classics'' in particu-lar. We identify the most commonly
               tagged ``classic'' literary works and find that Goodreads users
               have curated a vision of literature that is less diverse, in
               terms of the race and ethnicity of authors, than many U.S. high
               school and college syllabi. Drawing on computational methods such

               reinforcement of works as classics in other mediums and domains

               writing styles that often stand out in them (e.g., conversational
               and slangy language). Throughout the essay, we make the case that

                 work, ``The rise and fall of biodiversity in literature,'' by
                 Langer et al. (2021). Using a large corpus from Project
                 Gutenberg (N = ~15,000) and a dictionary-matching method of
                 over 240K biological taxa, Langer et al. find that the
                 frequency and diversity of biological taxa have been declining
                 steadily since the first half of the nineteenth century,
                 echoing prior work in cultural analytics. This paper applies
                 the original paper's three primary measures to two additional
                 data sets along with the original dataset and compares their
                 dictionary-based method with an alternative supervised machine
                 learning method. I find that the trajectory of biological
                 tokens in fiction in the new data sets is directionally
                 opposite to that shown by Langer et al. independent of the
                 methods used (i.e. taxa rise rather than fall since the first
                 half of the nineteenth century) but that their breakpoint
                 estimation appears largely robust within +/- 15 years. Based on
                 this analysis, I suggest that the discrepancy between our
                 results is due to corpus construction rather than choice of
                 method. I find that only conditioning on fiction in the
                 original dataset generates results more similar to the two
                 alternative datasets used here. In addition to emphasizing the
                 importance of corpus construction for cultural analytics, these
                 findings also raise larger questions about the difficulties of
                 interpreting lexical items as indeces of social attitudes,
                 pointing to a need for future work.",

  abstract = "The relationship between character identity and character action
              is an established topic of literary study. In Morphology of the
              Folktale, Vladimir Propp argues against the separation of ``who
              acts'' from ``the question of the actions themselves,'' instead
              advocating an approach that studies characters according to their
              functions.1 Similarly, the notion of the literary archetype, as
              influenced by both Joseph Campbell and Carl Jung, highlights the
              way in which what characters do influences the way we perceive who
              characters are.2 The notion of literary stereotypes is also tied
              to this discussion. As Bamman, O'Connor, and Smith observe in
              their study of personas in film, stereotypical characters are
              ``defined by a fixed set of actions widely known to be
              representative of a class.''3 While actions are only one part of a
              complex network of descriptive tools that authors may use to
              create characters, 4 they may offer us a useful insight into the
              way that certain behaviors can align with various character
              identity traits in literature. A study of character action may
              serve as a proxy to not only demarcate character types, but also
              to investigate what behaviors, and types of behaviors, were
              conventionally aligned with different groups of characters.
              Bamman, Underwood, and Smith (2014) attempt something similar in
              ``A Bayesian Mixed Effects Model of Literary Character.'' In that
              work, the authors focus on modeling specific character
              ``personas'' by studying semantically related words that occur in
              proximity to character mentions. The authors note that
              ``articulating what a true 'persona' might be for characters is
              inherently problematic'' and they acknowledge that the ``personas
              learned so far [by their model] do not align neatly with character
              types known to literary historians.''5 Nevertheless, their study
              revealed compelling associations between certain personas and
              certain genres and, more importantly for our current research,
              that certain personas were ``clearly gendered.'' 6 In noting the
              later, the authors write that ``analysis of latent character types
              might cast new light on the history of gender in fiction.''7 Our
              work attempts a more direct and specific study of character agency
              in the context of character gender. To do this, we explore trends
              in behavior associated with male and female characters in 3,329

              between immersion in a game and immersion in a movie or novel?
              What are the new possibilities for representation offered by the
              emerging technology of virtual reality? As Marie-Laure Ryan
              demonstrates in Narrative as Virtual Reality, the questions raised
              by new, interactive technologies have their precursors and echoes
              in pre-electronic literary and artistic traditions. Formerly a
              culture of immersive idealsgetting lost in a good book, for
              examplewe are becoming, Ryan claims, a culture more concerned
              with interactivity. Approaching the idea of virtual reality as a
              metaphor for total art, Narrative as Virtual Reality applies the
              concepts of immersion and interactivity to develop a phenomenology
              of reading. Ryan's analysis encompasses both traditional literary
              narratives and the new textual genres made possible by the
              electronic revolution of the past few years, such as hypertext,
              electronic poetry, interactive movies and drama, digital
              installation art, and computer role-playing games. Interspersed
              among the book's chapters are several ``interludes'' that focus
              exclusively on either key literary texts that foreshadow what we
              now call ``virtual reality,'' including those of Baudelaire,
              Huysmans, Ignatius de Loyola, Calvino, and science-fiction author
              Neal Stephenson, or recent efforts to produce interactive art
              forms, like the hypertext ``novel'' Twelve Blue, by Michael Joyce,
              and I'm Your Man, an interactive movie. As Ryan considers the fate
              of traditional narrative patterns in digital culture, she revisits
              one of the central issues in modern literary theorythe opposition
              between a presumably passive reading that is taken over by the
              world a text represents and an active, deconstructive reading that
              imaginatively participates in the text's creation. About the
              Author: Marie-Laure Ryan is an independent scholar and former

               well as for social interaction and for the establishment and
               development of social networks among scientists. However, the
               virtual dimension of conferences, in which individuals are not
               physically present in the same place, begins to emerge as an
               increasingly used possibility, which implies a different framing
               of these scientific events. This paper seeks to comparatively
               analyse several models of academic conferences, putting forth
               their advantages, limitations and potentials. Furthermore, it
               also seeks to reasonably envision the importance and challenges
               to be faced in the near future. The analysis allows concluding
               that virtual conferences tend to take on an increasingly central

               aspects, and predict aspect ratings simultaneously. Topic models
               have been widely adapted to jointly model aspects and sentiments,

               their weakness in sentiment extraction. The sentiment topics

               ratings, and the model may fail to extract certain kinds of
               sentiments due to skewed data. To tackle this problem, we propose
               a sentiment-aligned topic model(SATM), where we incorporate two

              What are the CENTRAL PROPOSITIONS associated with different
              stances on an issue; what are the abstract objects under
              discussion that are central to a speaker's argument? How can we
              recognize that two CENTRAL PROPOSITIONS realize the same FACET of
              the argument? We hypothesize that the CENTRAL PROPOSITIONS are
              exactly those arguments that people find most salient, and use
              human summarization as a probe for discovering them. We describe
              our corpus of human summaries of opinionated dialogs, then show
              how we can identify similar repeated arguments, and group them
              into FACETS across many discussions of a topic. We define a new

              a statistical approach to metaphor detection that utilizes the
              rarity of novel metaphors, marking words that do not match a
              text's typical vocabulary as metaphor candidates. No knowledge of
              semantic concepts or the metaphor's source domain is required. We
              analyze the performance of this approach as a stand-alone
              classifier and as a feature in a machine learning model, reporting
              improvements in F 1 measure over a random baseline of 58\% and

              This work draws on feminist values, driving design and research
              guidelines that account for the influences of power and neglect.
              This prior work is largely prescriptive, however, forgoing
              articulation of how feminist theories of knowledge-- or feminist
              epistemology -- can alter research design and outcomes. At the

              drawing attention to how a new framework for how we know what we
              know enabled us to overcome intellectual tensions in our research.
              Specifically, we focus on the theoretical concept of entanglement,
              central to recent feminist scholarship, and contribute: a history
              of entanglement in the broader scope of feminist theory; an
              articulation of the main points of entanglement theory for a
              visualization context; and a case study of research outcomes as
              evidence of the potential of feminist epistemology to impact
              visualization research. This work answers a call in the community
              to embrace a broader set of theoretical and epistemic foundations

              explain and maybe even cause variation in all forms of
              psychopathology. Since its ``discovery'' in 2012, hundreds of
              studies have been dedicated to the extraction and validation of
              statistical instantiations of the p-factor, called general factors
              of psychopathology. In this Perspective, we outline 5 major
              challenges in the p-factor literature, namely that it has: (1)
              mistakenly equated good model fit with validity; (2) sought to
              corroborate weak p-factor theories through underspecified
              construct validation efforts; (3) produced poorly replicated
              general factors of psychopathology; (4) violated assumptions of
              latent variable models; and (5) reified general factors of
              psychopathology as latent, causal entities, in turn neglecting
              alternative models that do not incorporate a p-factor and are
              entirely incompatible with the notion that a single dimension
              adequately summarizes variation in all forms of psychopathology.
              Each of these challenges raise questions about substantive
              interpretations of the p-factor (i.e., negative emotionality,
              thought disorder), undermining the field's confidence that the
              p-factor is a real, latent entity, or that GFPs are useful
              summaries of psychopathology variation. We conclude with ways to
              move forward, in the spirit of strengthening the p-factor
              literature and improving our ability to classify, treat, and
              prevent psychopathology across the lifespan.",

  abstract  = "IntroductionRecent studies have found that maternal health
               knowledge gaps exist among Black women, especially related to
               postpartum complications. The prenatal period is a key time when
               pregnant women have direct access to evidence-based sources, such
               as healthcare providers, to obtain maternal health and pregnancy
               information. Yet, Black pregnant women are also more likely to
               forgo or engage in prenatal care later than their White
               counterparts. In recent years, social media has become an
               essential source of pregnancy-related information and has been
               shown to effectively improve pregnancy knowledge. Social media
               has the potential to inform pregnant women about important
               pregnancy and postpartum health information. Yet, no studies to
               date have explored the type of maternal health content Black
               women are exposed to on popular pregnancy and parenting Instagram
               accounts.MethodsThis content analysis sought to identify what
               pregnancy topics appear and whether diverse birthing women's
               representation exists on Instagram accounts popular among
               birthing women. Instagram posts from three social media accounts
               commonly used for pregnancy and parenting information from 5/1/18
               to 4/30/21 were collected and then screened for maternal health
               content.ResultsA total of 212 maternal health posts were
               identified. Maternal health content represented 5\% (219 out of
               4,572 posts) of all posts shared by all accounts. About 35\% (69
               out of 196) of the images shared on all of the accounts included
               people but lacked diversity.ConclusionThese results highlight
               significant missed opportunities to share maternal health and
               Black maternal health content to educate and promote diversity
               among women who utilize these popular parenting Instagram
               accounts. Social media can be a viable and innovative solution to
               help create and promote maternal health information equity.",

              as well as enabling better decision-making in a variety of fields
              including public policy, healthcare, and economics. Many academics
              and practitioners have warned against the na\"{\i}ve usage of
              social data. There are biases and inaccuracies occurring at the
              source of the data, but also introduced during processing. There
              are methodological limitations and pitfalls, as well as ethical
              boundaries and unexpected consequences that are often overlooked.

                 Likert scales are plentiful in research and practice. IRA may
                 be implicated in job analysis, performance appraisal, panel
                 interviews, and any other approach to gathering systematic
                 observations. Any rating system involving subject-matter
                 experts can also benefit from IRA as a measure of consensus.
                 Further, IRA is fundamental to aggregation in multilevel
                 research, which is becoming increasingly common in order to
                 address nesting. Although, several technical descriptions of a
                 few specific IRA statistics exist, this paper aims to provide a
                 tractable orientation to common IRA indices to support
                 application. The introductory overview is written with the
                 intent of facilitating contrasts among IRA statistics by
                 critically reviewing equations, interpretations, strengths, and
                 weaknesses. Statistics considered include rwg, [Formula: see
                 text], r'wg, rwg(p), average deviation (AD), awg, standard
                 deviation (Swg), and the coefficient of variation (CVwg).
                 Equations support quick calculation and contrasting of
                 different agreement indices. The article also includes a
                 ``quick reference'' table and three figures in order to help
                 readers identify how IRA statistics differ and how
                 interpretations of IRA will depend strongly on the statistic
                 employed. A brief consideration of recommended practices
                 involving statistical and practical cutoff standards is

                 aimed at targeted social groups. Despite these serious
                 consequences and the wealth of available data, dehumanization
                 has not yet been computationally studied on a large scale.
                 Drawing upon social psychology research, we create a
                 computational linguistic framework for analyzing dehumanizing
                 language by identifying linguistic correlates of salient
                 components of dehumanization. We then apply this framework to
                 analyze discussions of LGBTQ people in the New York Times from
                 1986 to 2015. Overall, we find increasingly humanizing
                 descriptions of LGBTQ people over time. However, we find that
                 the label homosexual has emerged to be much more strongly
                 associated with dehumanizing attitudes than other labels, such
                 as gay. Our proposed techniques highlight processes of
                 linguistic variation and change in discourses surrounding
                 marginalized groups. Furthermore, the ability to analyze
                 dehumanizing language at a large scale has implications for

                 QUANTITATIVELY RELATE ITS THREE MAJOR BRANCHES OF RESEARCH:
                 brain-activity measurement, behavioral measurement, and
                 computational modeling. Using measured brain-activity patterns
                 to evaluate computational network models is complicated by the
                 need to define the correspondency between the units of the
                 model and the channels of the brain-activity data, e.g.,
                 single-cell recordings or voxels from functional magnetic
                 resonance imaging (fMRI). Similar correspondency problems
                 complicate relating activity patterns between different
                 modalities of brain-activity measurement (e.g., fMRI and
                 invasive or scalp electrophysiology), and between subjects and
                 species. In order to bridge these divides, we suggest
                 abstracting from the activity patterns themselves and computing
                 representational dissimilarity matrices (RDMs), which
                 characterize the information carried by a given representation
                 in a brain or model. Building on a rich psychological and
                 mathematical literature on similarity analysis, we propose a
                 new experimental and data-analytical framework called
                 representational similarity analysis (RSA), in which
                 multi-channel measures of neural activity are quantitatively
                 related to each other and to computational theory and behavior
                 by comparing RDMs. We demonstrate RSA by relating
                 representations of visual objects as measured with fMRI in
                 early visual cortex and the fusiform face area to computational
                 models spanning a wide range of complexities. The RDMs are
                 simultaneously related via second-level application of
                 multidimensional scaling and tested using randomization and
                 bootstrap techniques. We discuss the broad potential of RSA,
                 including novel approaches to experimental design, and argue
                 that these ideas, which have deep roots in psychology and
                 neuroscience, will allow the integrated quantitative analysis

               distinguish to some extent between semantic relations, and argue
               that (the right kind of) distributional similarity indicates
               prop-erty overlap. For the second question, I suggest that if an

               is similar to crocodile, the agent can probabilistically infer
               properties of alligators from known properties of crocodiles.
               Distributional evidence is noisy and partial, so I adopt a

              not have sufficient examples for learning to statistically extract
              all the named-entities precisely. In this work, we evaluate what
              value may lie in automatically generated features based on
              distributional semantics when using machine-learning named entity
              recognition (NER). The features we generated and experimented with
              include n-nearest words, support vector machine (SVM)-regions, and
              term clustering, all of which are considered distributional
              semantic features. The addition of the n-nearest words feature
              resulted in a greater increase in F-score than by using a manually
              constructed lexicon to a baseline system. Although the need for
              relatively small-annotated corpora for retraining is not obviated,
              lexicons empirically derived from unannotated text can not only
              supplement manually created lexicons, but also replace them. This
              phenomenon is observed in extracting concepts from both biomedical
              literature and clinical notes.",

              entity linking. Firstly, expanding acronyms can effectively reduce
              the ambiguity of the acronym mentions. However, only rule-based
              approaches relying heavily on the presence of text markers have
              been used for entity linking. In this paper, we propose a
              supervised learning algorithm to expand more complicated acronyms
              encountered, which leads to 15.1\% accuracy improvement over
              state-of-the-art acronym expansion methods. Secondly, as entity
              linking annotation is expensive and labor intensive, to automate
              the annotation process without compromise of accuracy, we propose
              an instance selection strategy to effectively utilize the
              automatically generated annotation. In our selection strategy, an
              informative and diverse set of instances are selected for
              effective disambiguation. Lastly, topic modeling is used to model
              the semantic topics of the articles. These advancements give
              statistical significant improvement to entity linking

  title     = "{The Intellective Space: Thinking beyond Cognition}",

  abstract  = "The Intellective Space explores the nature and limits of thought.
               It celebrates the poetic virtues of language and the creative
               imperfections of our animal minds while pleading for a renewal of
               the humanities that is grounded in a study of the sciences.
               According to Laurent Dubreuil, we humans both say more than we
               think and think more than we say. Dubreuil's particular interest
               is the intellective space, where thought and knowledge are
               performed and shared. For Dubreuil, the term ``cognition'' refers
               to the minimal level of our mental operations. But he suggests
               that for humans there is an excess of cognition due to our
               extensive processing necessary for verbal language, brain
               dynamics, and social contexts. In articulating the intellective,
               Dubreuil includes ``the productive undoing of cognition.''
               Dubreuil grants that cognitive operations take place and that
               protocols of experimental psychology, new techniques of
               neuroimagery, and mathematical or computerized models provide
               access to a certain understanding of thought. But he argues that
               something in thinking bypasses cognitive structures. Seeking to
               theorize with the sciences, the book's first section develops the
               ``intellective hypothesis'' and points toward the potential
               journey of ideas going beyond cognition, after and before
               computation. The second part, ``Animal Meditations,'' pursues
               consequences of this hypothesis with regard to the disparaged but
               enduring project of metaphysics, with its emphasis on categories
               such as reality, humanness, and the soul.",

               theory, but this article argues that material technologies can be

               on a historically informed analysis of digital games, with
               special attention paid to home console video games and recent
               genre developments within this domain commonly referred to as
               motion gaming. The main point is that digital game genres imply
               structured embodied activity. A constitutive element of digital
               game mediation is a control interface geared to player
               embodiment, and I propose the concept of `interaction modes' to
               describe the coupling of technology and player embodiment and
               show how this can be integrated with genre theory. The resulting
               framework allows for increased attention to continuity and change

                 allocated in ambulatory care. Objective: To describe how
                 physician time is spent in ambulatory practice. Design:
                 Quantitative direct observational time and motion study (during
                 office hours) and self-reported diary (after hours). Setting:
                 U.S. ambulatory care in 4 specialties in 4 states (Illinois,
                 New Hampshire, Virginia, and Washington). Participants: 57 U.S.
                 physicians in family medicine, internal medicine, cardiology,
                 and orthopedics who were observed for 430 hours, 21 of whom
                 also completed after-hours diaries. Measurements: Proportions
                 of time spent on 4 activities (direct clinical face time,
                 electronic health record [EHR] and desk work, administrative
                 tasks, and other tasks) and self-reported after-hours work.
                 Results: During the office day, physicians spent 27.0\% of
                 their total time on direct clinical face time with patients and
                 49.2\% of their time on EHR and desk work. While in the
                 examination room with patients, physicians spent 52.9\% of the
                 time on direct clinical face time and 37.0\% on EHR and desk
                 work. The 21 physicians who completed after-hours diaries
                 reported 1 to 2 hours of after-hours work each night, devoted
                 mostly to EHR tasks. Limitations: Data were gathered in
                 self-selected, high-performing practices and may not be
                 generalizable to other settings. The descriptive study design
                 did not support formal statistical comparisons by physician and
                 practice characteristics. Conclusion: For every hour physicians
                 provide direct clinical face time to patients, nearly 2
                 additional hours is spent on EHR and desk work within the
                 clinic day. Outside office hours, physicians spend another 1 to
                 2 hours of personal time each night doing additional computer
                 and other clerical work. Primary Funding Source: American

              configure pregnant embodiment. Drawing on a detailed analysis of
              all such apps available in June 2015 in the two major global app
              stores Google Play and Apple App Store, we discuss how such

              self-surveillance using apps to reduce potential harm to women and

              ludification strategies and encourage the social sharing of
              pregnancy-related details as part of emphasising the enjoyable
              aspects of pregnancy. We found that both types of

              a collective inference model incorporating global ev- idence from

  abstract = "--Topic models provide a convenient way to analyze large of
              unclassified text. A topic contains a cluster of words that
              frequently occur together. A topic modeling can connect words with
              similar meanings and distinguish between uses of words with
              multiple meanings. This paper provides two categories that can be
              under the field of topic modeling. First one discusses the area of
              methods of topic modeling, which has four methods that can be
              considerable under this category. These methods are Latent
              semantic analysis (LSA), Probabilistic latent semantic analysis
              (PLSA), Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), and Correlated topic
              model (CTM). The second category is called topic evolution models,
              which model topics by considering an important factor time. In the
              second category, different models are discussed, such as topic
              over time (TOT), dynamic topic models (DTM), multiscale topic
              tomography, dynamic topic correlation detection, detecting topic
              evolution in scientific literature, etc. Keywords--Topic Modeling;

               requires both cross-domain and cross-genre sensitivity (Rehbein
               and Bildhauer, 2017). While the impact domain differences have on
               parser performance degradation is more easily measurable in
               respect to lexical differences, impact of genre differences can
               be more nuanced. With the predominance of pre-trained language
               models (LMs; e.g. BERT (Devlin et al., 2019)), there are now
               additional complexities in developing cross-genre sensitive
               models due to the infusion of linguistic characteristics derived
               from, usually, a third genre. We perform a systematic set of
               experiments using two neural constituency parsers to examine how

               with others. With the availability of inexpensive and ubiquitous

               false information and propaganda is both convenient and
               effective. Social media users leverage this platform to further
               their views by framing narratives and participating in online
               discourse. Almost all events, issues, crises are discussed on
               social media. Blogs, unlike other social media platforms, are not
               regulated by any authority and have no restriction on character
               limit, providing bloggers with not only space for richer content
               but also serve as a platform for agenda-setting and content
               framing abetting development of narratives. This innate feature
               of blogs makes them a valuable platform for
               sociologists/political scientists to gain situational awareness
               by tracking different opinions, political views, and narratives
               as they are shaped. However, the deluge of posts in blogosphere
               makes it impractical to manually identify narratives. In this
               paper, we propose a novel framework to computationally identify
               narratives by extracting actors/actions using NLP techniques
               including POS tagging, chunking, and grammar rules to identify
               narratives. We also employ a scoring mechanism to rank them in
               the order of their dominance. Later, we evaluate the efficacy of
               the proposed model by validating against human annotated
               narratives. Our framework achieved an accuracy of 66.8\%. Our
               proposed framework can help social scientists identify narratives
               computationally reducing human effort reasonably. Moreover, the
               results from this research could also be used to build effective
               counter narratives to stem propaganda campaigns.",

              news media play an important role in informing the public on
              current events. Yet it has been difficult to understand the
              comprehensiveness of news media coverage on an event and how the
              reactions that the coverage evokes may diverge, because this
              requires identifying the origin of an event and tracing the
              information all the way to individuals who consume the news. In
              this work, we pinpoint the information source of an event in the
              form of a press release and investigate how its news cycle
              unfolds. We follow the news through three layers of propagation:
              the news articles covering the press release, shares of those
              articles in social media, and comments on the shares. We find that
              a news cycle typically lasts two days. Although news media in
              aggregate cover the information contained in the source, a single
              news article will typically only provide partial coverage.
              Sentiment, while dampened in news coverage relative to the source,
              again rises in social media shares and comments. As the
              information propagates through the layers, it tends to diverge
              from the source: while some ideas emphasized in the source fade,
              others emerge or gain in importance. We also discover how far the
              news article is from the information source in terms of sentiment
              or language does not help predict its popularity.",

  abstract = "We encounter metaphors every day, but only a few jump out on us
              and make us stumble. However, little effort has been devoted to
              investigating more novel metaphors in comparison to general
              metaphor detection efforts. We attribute this gap primarily to the
              lack of larger datasets that distinguish between conventionalized,
              i.e., very common, and novel metaphors. The goal of this paper is
              to alleviate this situation by introducing a crowdsourced novel
              metaphor annotation layer for an existing metaphor corpus.
              Further, we analyze our corpus and investigate correlations
              between novelty and features that are typically used in metaphor
              detection, such as concreteness ratings and more semantic features
              like the Potential for Metaphoricity. Finally, we present a
              baseline approach to assess novelty in metaphors based on our
              annotations.",

                 and subdermal implants (SDI) are recommended as first-line
                 contraception for the majority of women by the American College
                 of Obstetrics and Gynecology, these methods of long-acting
                 reversible contraception (LARC) are underutilized. Some
                 concerns regarding their use include cost of placement, side
                 effects, and perception of frequent early removal. This study
                 evaluated satisfaction with LARC, frequency, and reasons behind
                 early removal in a family medicine setting. METHODS: Women > 18
                 years seen for placement of removal of an IUD or SDI were
                 identified from billing data and surveyed via telephone to
                 determine satisfaction and side effects with LARC. Additional
                 demographic information was extracted from the electronic
                 health record. RESULTS: Of the 132 respondents (response rate
                 61.4\%), 58.3\% had IUDs and 41.7\% had SDIs placed. Early
                 removal occurred in 24.2\% of women, and 72.7\% were satisfied
                 with their contraceptive choice. Younger and nulliparous women
                 were more likely to have an SDI placed, whereas older and
                 multiparous women chose the IUD. Younger nulliparous women were
                 less likely to have LARC removed early. Pain (more commonly
                 reported with the IUD) and increased frequency in bleeding
                 (more commonly reported with the SDI) were associated with
                 early removal rates. CONCLUSIONS: Most women who received LARC
                 were satisfied with their contraceptive choice, and only one in
                 four had the LARC removed early. This is significantly better
                 than continuation rates with other contraceptive methods.
                 Younger, nulliparous women were good candidates for LARC,

               years language models pre-trained on large corpora emerged as
               clear winners in numerous NLP tasks, but no proper analysis of
               the corpora which led to their success has been conducted. The
               paper presents a procedure for robust frequency estimation, which
               helps in establishing the core lexicon for a given corpus, as
               well as a procedure for estimating the corpus composition via
               unsupervised topic models and via supervised genre classification
               of Web pages. The results of the digital curation study applied
               to several Web-derived corpora demonstrate their considerable
               differences. First, this concerns different frequency bursts
               which impact the core lexicon obtained from each corpus. Second,
               this concerns the kinds of texts they contain. For example,
               OpenWebText contains considerably more topical news and political
               argumentation in comparison to ukWac or Wikipedia. The tools and

  abstract = "This thesis describes work on the detection of anomalous material
              in text without the use of training data. We use the term
              anomalous to refer to text that is irregular, or deviates
              significantly from its surrounding context. In this thesis we show
              that identifying such abnormalities in text can be viewed as a
              type of outlier detection because these anomalies will differ
              significantly from the writing style in the majority of the data.
              We consider segments of text which are anomalous with respect to
              topic (i.e. about a different subject), author (written by a
              different person), or genre (written for a different audience or
              from a different source) and experiment with whether it is
              possible to identify these anomalous segments automatically. Five
              different innovative approaches to this problem are introduced and
              assessed using many experiments over large document collections,
              created to contain randomly inserted anomalous segments. In order
              to identify anomalies in text successfully, we investigate and
              evaluate 166 stylistic and linguistic features used to
              characterize writing, some of which are well-established stylistic
              determiners, but many of which are original. Using these features
              with each of our methods, we examine the effect of segment size on
              our ability to detect anomaly, allowing segments of size 100
              words, 500 words and 1000 words. We show substantial improvements
              over a baseline in all cases for all methods, and identify a novel
              method which performs consistently better than others and the
              features that contribute most to unsupervised anomaly detection.",

              topic scoring models to the evaluation task, drawing on WordNet,
              Wikipedia and the Google search engine, and existing research on
              lexical similarity/relatedness. In comparison with human scores
              for a set of learned topics over two distinct datasets, we show a
              simple co-occurrence measure based on point- wise mutual
              information over Wikipedia data is able to achieve results for the
              task at or nearing the level of inter-annotator correlation, and
              that other Wikipedia-based lexical relatedness methods also
              achieve strong results. Google produces strong, if less
              consistent, results, while our results over WordNet are patchy at
              best.",

              applications, it is critical to consider not only their accuracy
              but also their robustness to changes in the data distribution. In
              this paper, we consider the case where there is a confounding
              variable Z that influences both the text features X and the class
              variable Y . For example, a classifier trained to predict the
              health status of a user based on their online communications may
              be confounded by socioeconomic variables. When the influence of Z
              changes from training to testing data, we find that classifier
              accuracy can degrade rapidly. Our approach, based on Pearl's
              back-door adjustment, estimates the underlying effect of a text
              variable on the class variable while controlling for the
              confounding variable. Although our goal is prediction, not causal
              inference, we find that such adjustments are essential to building
              text classifiers that are robust to confounding variables. On
              three diverse text classifications tasks, we find that covariate
              adjustment results in higher accuracy than competing baselines
              over a range of confounding relationships (e.g., in one setting,
              accuracy improves from 60\% to 81\%).",

              generally for dimension-reduction of sparse count data. These
              types of models and algorithms can be viewed as generating an
              abstraction from the words in a document to a lower-dimensional
              latent variable representation that captures what the document is
              generally about beyond the specific words it contains. In this
              paper we propose a new probabilistic model that tempers this
              approach by representing each document as a combination of (a) a
              background distribution over common words, (b) a mixture
              distribution over general topics, and (c) a distribution over
              words that are treated as being specific to that document. We
              illustrate how this model can be used for information retrieval by
              matching documents both at a general topic level and at a specific
              word level, providing an advantage over techniques that only match
              documents at a general level (such as topic models or
              latent-sematic indexing) or that only match documents at the
              specific word level (such as TF-IDF).",

              proposed an alternative theoretical framework, embodied cognition,
              as a way of understanding the predominance of structural things.
              In this paper, we apply machine learning based predictive models
              on two large data sets of historical and contemporary 昀椀ction to
              better understand the role that things play in 昀椀ctional writing.
              A large body of scholarship known as ``thing theory'' has
              attempted to understand the function of 昀椀ctional things within
              literature mostly by focusing on small case studies. We provide
              the 昀椀rst-ever estimates of the distribution of di昀昀erent types of
              things in English-language 昀椀ction over the past two centuries
              along with experiments to model their semantic identity. Our
              昀椀ndings suggest that the most common 昀椀ctional things are
              structural in nature, functioning akin to narrative props. We
              conclude by showing how these 昀椀ndings pose problems for inherited
              theories of 昀椀ctional things and propose an alternative
              theoretical framework, embodied cognition, as a way of

              i.e., mention-entry similarity, entry-entry similarity, and
              mention-mention similarity, to enrich the context for entity
              linking, and to address irregular mentions that are not covered by
              the entity-variation dictionary. We evaluate our method on a

              representations for words from local co-occurrences in sentences.
              The WMD distance measures the dissimilarity between two text

              studied transportation problem for which several highly efficient
              solvers have been developed. Our metric has no hyperparameters and

              find more name variations for entity linking task. In addition, as
              manually creating a training corpus for entity linking is

              This classifier not only can effectively reduce the ambiguities to
              the existing entities in KB, but also be very useful to highlight
              the new entities to KB for the further population. Furthermore, we

              appealing due to their well-known ``explainability,'' most, if not
              all, state-of-the-art results for NER tasks are based on machine
              learning techniques. Motivated by these results, we explore the
              following natural question in this paper: Are rule-based systems
              still a viable approach to named-entity recognition? Specifically,
              we have designed and implemented a high-level language NERL on top
              of SystemT, a general-purpose algebraic information extraction
              system. NERL is tuned to the needs of NER tasks and simplifies the
              process of building, understanding, and customizing complex
              rule-based named-entity annotators. We show that these customized
              annotators match or outperform the best published results achieved
              with machine learning techniques. These results confirm that we
              can reap the benefits of rule-based extractors' explainability
              without sacrificing accuracy. We conclude by discussing lessons
              learned while building and customizing complex rule-based
              annotators and outlining several research directions towards
              facilitating rule development.",

              the mental health of mult bilingual users and shows that being the
              bridges, multilingual Users tend to be more negative. The outbreak
              of the COVID-19 pandemic triggers infodemic over online social
              networks. It is thus important for governments to ensure their
              official messages outpace misinformation and efficiently reach the
              public. Some countries and regions that are currently worst
              affected by the virus including Europe, South America and India,
              encounter an additional difficulty: multilingualism. Understanding
              the specific role of multilingual users in the process of
              information diffusion is critical to adjust their publishing
              strategies for the governments of such countries and regions. In
              this paper, we investigate the role of multilingual users in

              information. We further study the mental health of multilingual
              users and show that being the bridges, multilingual users tend to
              be more negative. This is confirmed by a recent psychological

  author   = "Gharbieh, Waseem and Bhavsar, Virendra and Cook, Paul",
  journal  = "MWE@ACL",
  abstract = "Verb--noun idiomatic combinations (VNICs) are idioms consisting of
              a verb with a noun in its direct object position. Usages of these
              expressions can be ambiguous between an idiomatic usage and a
              literal combination. In this paper we propose supervised and
              unsupervised approaches, based on word embeddings, to identifying
              token instances of VNICs. Our proposed supervised and unsupervised
              approaches perform better than the supervised and unsupervised
              approaches of Fazly et al. (2009), respectively. 1 Verb--noun
              Idiomatic Combinations Much research on multiword expressions
              (MWEs) in natural language processing (NLP) has focused on various
              type-level prediction tasks, e.g., MWE extraction (e.g., Church
              and Hanks, 1990; Smadja, 1993; Lin, 1999) -- i.e., determining
              which MWE types are present in a given corpus (Baldwin and Kim,
              2010) -- and compositionality prediction (e.g., McCarthy et al.,
              2003; Reddy et al., 2011; Salehi et al., 2014). However, word
              combinations can be ambiguous between literal combinations and
              MWEs. For example, consider the following two usages of the
              expression hit the roof : 1. I think Paula might hit the roof if
              you start ironing. 2. When the blood hit the roof of the car I
              realised it was serious. The first example of hit the roof is an
              idiomatic usage, while the second is a literal combination.1 MWE
              identification is the task of determining These examples, and
              idiomaticity judgements, are taken from Cook et al. (2008). which
              token instances in running text are MWEs (Baldwin and Kim, 2010).
              Although there has been relatively less work on MWE identification
              than other type-level MWE prediction tasks, it is nevertheless
              important for NLP applications such as machine translation that
              must be able to distinguish MWEs from literal combinations in
              context. Some recent work has focused on token-level
              identification of a wide range of types of MWEs and other
              multiword units (e.g., Newman et al., 2012; Schneider et al.,
              2014; Brooke et al., 2014). Many studies, however, have taken a
              word sense disambiguation--inspired approach to MWE identification
              (e.g., Birke and Sarkar, 2006; Katz and Giesbrecht, 2006; Li et
              al., 2010), treating literal combinations and MWEs as different
              word senses, and have exploited linguistic knowledge of MWEs
              (e.g., Patrick and Fletcher, 2005; Uchiyama et al., 2005;
              Hashimoto and Kawahara, 2008; Fazly et al., 2009; Fothergill and
              Baldwin, 2012). In this study we focus on English verb--noun
              idiomatic combinations (VNICs). VNICs are formed from a verb with
              a noun in its direct object position. They are a common and
              productive type of English idiom, and occur cross-lingually (Fazly
              et al., 2009). VNICs tend to be relatively lexico-syntactically
              fixed, e.g., whereas hit the roof is ambiguous between literal and
              idiomatic meanings, hit the roofs and a roof was hit are most
              likely to be literal usages. Fazly et al. (2009) exploit this
              property in their unsupervised approach, referred to as CFORM.
              They define lexico-syntactic patterns for VNIC token instances
              based on the noun's determiner (e.g., a, the, or possibly no
              determiner), the number of the noun (singular or plural), and the
              verb's voice (active or passive). They propose a statistical
              method for automatically determining a given VNIC type's canonical
              idiomatic form, based on the frequency of its usage in these",

              models have achieved impressive few-shot performance on a wide
              variety of tasks. However, in many settings, users require
              confidence estimates for model predictions. While traditional
              classifiers produce scores for each label, language models instead
              produce scores for the generation which may not be well
              calibrated. We compare generations across diverse prompts and show
              that these can be used to create confidence scores. By utilizing
              more prompts we can get more precise confidence estimates and use
              response diversity as a proxy for confidence. We evaluate this
              approach across ten multiple-choice question-answering datasets
              using three models: T0, FLAN-T5, and GPT-3. In addition to
              analyzing multiple human written prompts, we automatically
              generate more prompts using a language model in order to produce
              finer-grained confidence estimates. Our method produces more
              calibrated confidence estimates compared to the log probability of
              the answer to a single prompt. These improvements could benefit
              users who rely on prediction confidence for integration into a

              named entity recognition, the most basic text extraction problem,
              resulting in significant progress by different research teams

              open source system implementing the advances described in the

              executable survey of advances in biomedical named entity
              recognition, intended to serve as a benchmark for the field.
              BANNER is implemented in Java as a machine-learning system based
              on conditional random fields and includes a wide survey of the
              best techniques recently described in the literature. It is
              designed to maximize domain independence by not employing brittle
              semantic features or rule-based processing steps, and achieves
              significantly better performance than existing baseline systems.
              It is therefore useful to developers as an extensible NER
              implementation, to researchers as a standard for comparing
              innovative techniques, and to biologists requiring the ability to
              find novel entities in large amounts of text.",

  title     = "{Learning narrative structure from annotated folktales}",
  author    = "Finlayson, Mark (mark Alan)",
  publisher = "Massachusetts Institute of Technology",
  abstract  = "Narrative structure is an ubiquitous and intriguing phenomenon.
               By virtue of structure we recognize the presence of Villainy or
               Revenge in a story, even if that word is not actually present in
               the text. Narrative structure is an anvil for forging new
               artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques, and is a
               window into abstraction and conceptual learning as well as into
               culture and its in influence on cognition. I advance our
               understanding of narrative structure by describing Analogical
               Story Merging (ASM), a new machine learning algorithm that can
               extract culturally-relevant plot patterns from sets of folktales.
               I demonstrate that ASM can learn a substantive portion of
               Vladimir Propp's in influential theory of the structure of
               folktale plots. The challenge was to take descriptions at one
               semantic level, namely, an event timeline as described in
               folktales, and abstract to the next higher level: structures such
               as Villainy, Stuggle- Victory, and Reward. ASM is based on
               Bayesian Model Merging, a technique for learning regular
               grammars. I demonstrate that, despite ASM's large search space, a
               carefully-tuned prior allows the algorithm to converge, and
               furthermore it reproduces Propp's categories with a
               chance-adjusted Rand index of 0.511 to 0.714. Three important
               categories are identied with F-measures above 0.8. The data are
               15 Russian folktales, comprising 18,862 words, a subset of
               Propp's original tales. This subset was annotated for 18 aspects
               of meaning by 12 annotators using the Story Workbench, a general
               text-annotation tool I developed for this work. Each aspect was
               doubly-annotated and adjudicated at inter-annotator F-measures
               that cluster around 0.7 to 0.8. It is the largest, most
               deeply-annotated narrative corpus assembled to date. The work has
               significance far beyond folktales. First, it points the way
               toward important applications in many domains, including
               information retrieval, persuasion and negotiation, natural
               language understanding and generation, and computational
               creativity. Second, abstraction from natural language semantics
               is a skill that underlies many cognitive tasks, and so this work
               provides insight into those processes. Finally, the work opens
               the door to a computational understanding of cultural in
               influences on cognition and understanding cultural differences as
               captured in stories.",

              this purpose, we use context embeddings derived from word

               media, it is crucial to study health-related narratives in social
               media. However, expert identification of a large number of
               narrative texts is a time consuming process, and larger scale
               studies on the use of narratives may be enabled through automatic
               text classification approaches. Prior work has demonstrated that
               automatic narrative detection is possible, but modern deep
               learning approaches have not been used for this task in the
               domain of online health communities. Therefore, in this paper, we
               explore the use of deep learning methods to automatically
               classify the presence of narratives in social media posts,

               better understand the increase in performance achieved by deep
               learning models, we use feature analysis techniques to explore
               the features that most contribute to narrative detection for

              summary. The core of the measure is covered by Latent Semantic
              Analysis (LSA) which can capture the main topics of a document.
              The summarization systems are ranked according to the similarity
              of the main topics of their summaries and their reference
              documents. Results show a high correlation between human rankings
              and the LSA-based evaluation measure. The measure is designed to
              compare a summary with its full text. It can compare a summary
              with a human written abstract as well; however, in this case using
              a standard ROUGE measure gives more precise results. Nevertheless,

                  research, especially with respect to narrative understanding
                  and story generation. Past research in poetics and reading
                  comprehension has identified the expression of causal
                  relations as one of the primary functions of narrative
                  communication. Nevertheless, causality detection remains a
                  formidable challenge for NLP. A recent survey by Ali et al.
                  highlights the many challenges of this interdisciplinary
                  research across multiple domains [1]. One area that remains
                  under-researched is that of cross-domain consistency, whether
                  causal relations and their detection behave in similar ways
                  across different kinds of texts. As Bamman et al. have
                  established, many NLP systems lose considerable performance
                  when applied on fictional texts [2]. In this paper, we thus
                  establish the relative performance of baseline causal mining
                  models on examples drawn from fictional narratives and compare
                  them with standard NLP benchmarks drawn from SemEval data.
                  With a new labeled dataset that we introduce, we train models
                  to detect causality within and between sentences, and uncover
                  linguistic features that indicate a causal relationship
                  between phrases. This research surfaces a range of questions
                  that will help advance the further study of understanding
                  causality in narrative.",

              study was to clarify how decisions were made in labor by analyzing
              women's birth stories. METHODS: A convenience sample of 15
              primiparous and multiparous Midwestern women contributed a total
              of 33 birth stories. Qualitative methods were used, including
              analyses of the content and themes of stories. RESULTS: The
              primary types of decision making that were identified ranged on a
              continuum from unilateral to joint (shared), and were associated
              with various emotions expressed by the women. CONCLUSIONS: A model
              of decision making was derived from the data that may help
              caregivers change practices in ways that will benefit women.
              Caregivers can also benefit by understanding women's critiques of
              the birth care they received, and can use this knowledge to
              improve women's experiences of birth and therefore their

              identifying and classifying names in text, often solved by
              statistical learning systems. Our approach utilises the text of
              Wikipedia, a free online encyclopedia, transforming links between
              Wikipedia articles into entity annotations. Having derived a
              baseline corpus, we found that altering Wikipedia's links and
              identifying classes of capitalised non-entity terms would enable
              the corpus to conform more closely to gold-standard annotations,
              increasing performance by up to 32\% F score. The evaluation of
              our method is novel since the training corpus is not usually a
              variable in NER experimentation. We therefore develop a number of
              methods for analysing and comparing training corpora.
              Gold-standard training corpora for NER perform poorly (F score up
              to 32\% lower) when evaluated on test data from a different
              gold-standard corpus. OurWikipedia-derived data can outperform
              manually-annotated corpora on this cross-corpus evaluation task by
              up to 7\% on held-out test data. These experimental results show
              thatWikipedia is viable as a source of automatically-annotated

              such as language generation, machine translation and word sense
              disambiguation. We present methods of non-compositionality
              detection for English noun compounds using the unsupervised
              learning of a semantic composition function. Compounds which are
              not well modeled by the learned semantic composition function are

              these models, and propose additional methods which improve results
              further. We show that a complex function such as polynomial
              projection can learn semantic composition and identify
              non-compositionality in an unsupervised way, beating all other
              baselines ranging from simple to complex. We show that enforcing
              sparsity is a useful regularizer in learning complex composition
              functions. We show further improvements by training a
              decomposition function in addition to the composition function.

              the following disadvantages: (1) They are inefficient for the data
              sets with short strings (the average string length is no larger
              than 30); (2) They involve large indexes; (3) They are expensive
              to support dynamic update of data sets. To address these problems,
              we propose a novel framework called trie-join, which can generate
              results effi- ciently with small indexes. We use a trie structure
              to index the strings and utilize the trie structure to efficiently
              find the similar string pairs based on subtrie pruning. We de-
              vise efficient trie-join algorithms and pruning techniques to
              achieve high performance. Our method can be easily ex- tended to
              support dynamic update of data sets efficiently. Experimental
              results show that our algorithms outperform state-of-the-art
              methods by an order of magnitude on three real data sets with
              short strings.",

               genuinely intelligent and to interact naturally with us, we must
               give computers the ability to recognize, understand, even to have
               and express emotions. The latest scientific findings indicate
               that emotions play an essential role in decision making,
               perception, learning, and more--that is, they influence the very
               mechanisms of rational thinking. Not only too much, but too
               little emotion can impair decision making. According to Rosalind
               Picard, if we want computers to be genuinely intelligent and to
               interact naturally with us, we must give computers the ability to
               recognize, understand, even to have and express emotions. Part 1
               of this book provides the intellectual framework for affective
               computing. It includes background on human emotions, requirements
               for emotionally intelligent computers, applications of affective
               computing, and moral and social questions raised by the
               technology. Part 2 discusses the design and construction of
               affective computers. Although this material is more technical
               than that in Part 1, the author has kept it less technical than
               typical scientific publications in order to make it accessible to
               newcomers. Topics in Part 2 include signal-based representations
               of emotions, human affect recognition as a pattern recognition
               and learning problem, recent and ongoing efforts to build models
               of emotion for synthesizing emotions in computers, and the new

               with a large community by coordinating with different
               interlocutors within short conversations. This ability is largely
               understudied by the research on building neural language
               communicative agents. We study the task of few-shot language
               coordination: agents quickly adapting to their conversational
               partners' language abilities. Different from current
               communicative agents trained with self-play, we in- investigate
               this more general paradigm by requiring the lead agent to
               coordinate with a population of agents each of whom has different
               linguistic abilities. This leads to a general agent able to
               quickly adapt to communicating with unseen agents in the
               population. Unlike prior work, success here requires the ability
               to model the partner's beliefs, a vital component of human
               communication. Drawing inspiration from the study of
               theory-of-mind (ToM; Premack \& Woodruff (1978)), we study the
               effect of the speaker explicitly modeling the listener's mental
               state. Learning by communicating with a population, the speakers,
               as shown in our experiments, acquire the ability to learn to
               predict the reactions of their partner upon various messages
               on-the-fly. The speaker's predictions for the future actions help
               it generate the best instructions in order to maximize
               communicative goal with message costs. To examine our hypothesis
               that the instructions generated with ToM modeling yield better
               communication per- performance, we employ our agents in both a
               referential game and a language navigation task. Positive results
               from our experiments also hint at the importance of explicitly
               modeling language acquisition as a socio-pragmatic progress.",

              content of confounding documents and the probability that each of

              specifically candidate generation in spelling error correction,
              which is a task as follows. Given a misspelled word, the system
              finds words in a dictionary, which are most ``similar'' to the
              misspelled word. The paper proposes a probabilistic approach to
              the task, which is both accurate and efficient. The approach
              includes the use of a log linear model, a method for training the
              model, and an algorithm for finding the top k candidates. The log
              linear model is defined as a condi- tional probability
              distribution of a corrected word and a rule set for the correction
              con- ditioned on the misspelled word. The learn- ing method
              employs the criterion in candidate generation as loss function.
              The retrieval al- gorithm is efficient and is guaranteed to find
              the optimal k candidates. Experimental re- sults on large scale
              data show that the pro- posed approach improves upon existing

              require user input. Having the system complete a partially typed
              ``word'' can save user time and effort. In this paper, we study
              the problem of autocompletion not just at the level of a single
              ``word'', but at the level of a multi-word ``phrase''. There are
              two main challenges: one is that the number of phrases (both the
              number possible and the number actually observed in a corpus) is
              combina- torially larger than the number of words; the second is
              that a ``phrase'', unlike a ``word'', does not have a well-defined
              boundary, so that the autocompletion system has to decide not just
              what to predict, but also how far. We introduce a FussyTree
              structure to address the first challenge and the concept of a
              significant phrase to address the second. We develop a
              probabilistically driven multi- ple completion choice model, and
              exploit features such as frequency distributions to improve the
              quality of our suffix completions. We experimentally demonstrate
              the practica- bility and value of our technique for an email
              composition application and show that we can save approximately a
              fifth of the keystrokes typed.",

              from ``folk'' and ``taxonomy'' (Smith, 2004) to describe systems
              in which people (not professional indexers) assign natural
              language descriptors to resources. Many definitions of varying
              precision and breadth have been used for ``folksonomy'' (Vander
              Wal, 2005), and a variety of similar terms have been proposed
              (Merholz, 2005), but the term folksonomy appears to have become
              the most accepted. Because of the echo of ``taxonomy'', folksonomy
              is often incorrectly described as classification, but it is
              actually more correctly labeled categorization or indexing
              (Mathes, 2004). Folksonomies appear in many current web
              applications, most famously in the ``social bookmarking'' service
              del.icio.us, in which users bookmark and tag web pages, and the

              deprecated or redacted datasets, including ImageNet, 80 Million
              Tiny Images, MS-Celeb-1M, Duke MTMC, Brainwash, and HRT

              machine learning dataset is deprecated for legal, ethical, or
              technical reasons, but continues to be widely used? In this paper,
              we examine the public afterlives of several prominent deprecated
              or redacted datasets, including ImageNet, 80 Million Tiny Images,
              MS-Celeb-1M, Duke MTMC, Brainwash, and HRT Transgender, in order
              to inform a framework for more consistent, ethical, and
              accountable dataset deprecation. Building on prior research [27,
              35, 61], we find that there is a lack of consistency,
              transparency, and centralized sourcing of information on the
              deprecation of datasets, and as such, these datasets and their
              derivatives continue to be cited in papers and circulate online.
              These datasets that never die -- which we term ``zombie datasets''
              -- continue to inform the design of production-levelsystems,
              causing technical, legal, and ethical challenges; in so doing,
              they risk perpetuating the harms that prompted their supposed
              withdrawal, including concerns around bias, discrimination, and
              privacy. Based on this analysis, we propose a Dataset Deprecation
              Framework that includes considerations of risk, mitigation of
              impact, appeal mechanisms, timeline, post-deprecation protocol,
              and publication checks that can be adapted and implemented by the
              machine learning community. Drawing on work on datasheets and
              checklists [29, 48], we further offer two sample dataset
              deprecation sheets and propose a centralized repository that
              tracks which datasets have been deprecated and could be
              incorporated into the publication protocols of venues like
              NeurIPS.",

               traditional social media sites like Facebook and Twitter, posts
               on anonymous social media sites are not associated with well
               defined user identities or profiles. In this study, our goals are
               two-fold: (i) to understand the nature (sensitivity, types) of
               content posted on anonymous social media sites and (ii) to
               investigate the differences between content posted on anonymous
               and non-anonymous social me- dia sites like Twitter. To this end,
               we gather and analyze ex- tensive content traces from Whisper
               (anonymous) and Twitter (non-anonymous) social media sites. We
               introduce the notion of anonymity sensitivity of a social media
               post, which captures the extent to which users think the post
               should be anonymous. We also propose a human annotator based
               methodology to measure the same for Whisper and Twitter posts.
               Our analysis reveals that anonymity sensitivity of most whispers
               (unlike tweets) is not binary. Instead, most whispers exhibit
               many shades or different levels of anonymity. We also find that
               the linguistic differences between whispers and tweets are so
               significant that we could train automated classifiers to
               distinguish between them with reasonable accuracy. Our findings
               shed light on human behavior in anonymous media systems that lack
               the notion of an identity and they have important implications

                  embeddings can aid identification of narratives. We also
                  investigate which features distinguish narratives from other
                  social media posts. This study is the first to automatically
                  identify the topics discussed in narratives on a patient
                  forum. Our results show that for classifying narratives,
                  character 3-grams outperform psycho-linguistic features and
                  document embeddings. We found that narratives are
                  characterized by the use of past tense, health-related words
                  and first-person pronouns, whereas non-narrative text is
                  associated with the future tense, emotional support words and
                  second-person pronouns. Topic analysis of the patient
                  narratives uncovered fourteen different medical topics,
                  ranging from tumor surgery to side effects. Future work will
                  use these methods to extract experiential patient knowledge
                  from social media.",

  abstract = "(from the introduction) Addresses H. Frankfurt's account of
              bullshit. This chapter singles out 2 respects in which the account
              appears to be incomplete. First, in claiming that indifference to
              the truth is the essence of bullshit, Frankfurt overlooks a second
              mode of discourse, ``unclarifiable unclarity,'' to which, the
              author argues, the term also applies. Second, Frankfurt
              misrepresents the relationship between even his variety of
              bullshit and lying; and this reflects his failure to distinguish
              the bullshitter's tactics from his goals. To the extent that some
              bullshit presupposes an indifference to truth, the author
              contends, the indifference is at the level of tactics: though the
              bullshitter is indifferent to whether he/she utters the truth,
              he/she may have a keen interest in whether he/she causes others to
              believe something false. Having raised these issues regarding
              Frankfurt's account, this chapter concludes by examining the
              unclarifiable discourse that especially interests the author.

  abstract = "Genre is a contentious topic in any medium. Genre fiction or
              ``genred'' fiction carries with it a mark of marginality. A
              typical remark from a New York Times Book Reviewdemonstrates this
              pattern: ``science fiction will never be Literature with a capital
              `'L,'' and this is because it inevitably proceeds from premise
              rather than character'' (Birkerts). Similarly, fiction titles of
              specific genres such as Western and Science Fiction bear
              conspicuous labels that distinguish works like Dunefrom the
              unmarked, real fiction, saying in effect, ``Warning--this is not
              really Literature.'' While there is some degree of generic
              criticism (that is, criticism that asserts one genre's superiority
              to all other genres based on nothing more than its distinguishing
              criticism) in game journalismand reception, there have only been a
              few attempts to deal with the issue of genre in game studies. It
              is my goal to reach an understanding of the conflicting generic
              sensibilities established by video game journalism on the one hand
              and game studies scholarship on the other. A common rhetorical
              phenomenon in writing about video games is to begin with a broad
              statement invoking the volume of games produced or the surpassing
              quality of the most recent generation of games to ``wow'' skeptics
              into considering the possibility that games mean something more
              than play. As this essay has a more meta-critical approach, it
              seems appropriate instead to pay appropriate respect to the
              growing amount of critical literature on gaming and avoid the
              apologetics that many earlier scholars have felt obligated to
              undergo. Games have indeed come a long way, and so has game
              scholarship. The recent publication of The Video Game Theory
              Reader (edited by Mark J.P. Wolf and Bernard Perron) indicates
              both that reading is an appropriate task for learning about games
              and that a critical mass of viewpoints exists to justify an
              anthology of wildly different and, sometimes, antithetical
              scholarship on video games",

              with the same lemma across similar tweets, whose value indicates
              whether the two related words are mentions of the same entity. We
              evaluate our method on a manually annotated data set, and show
              that our method outperforms the baseline that handles these two
              tasks separately, boosting the F1 from 80.2\% to 83.6\% for NER,

              In recent years, statistical models have been used for the task.
              However, such models without any domain knowledge often produce
              aspects that are not interpretable in applications. To tackle the
              issue, some knowledge-based topic models have been proposed, which
              allow the user to input some prior domain knowledge to generate
              coherent aspects. However, existing knowledge-based topic models
              have several major shortcomings, e.g., little work has been done
              to incorporate the cannot-link type of knowledge or to
              automatically adjust the number of topics based on domain
              knowledge. This paper proposes a more advanced topic model, called
              MC-LDA (LDA with m-set and c-set), to address these problems,
              which is based on an Extended generalized P\'{o}lya urn (E-GPU)
              model (which is also proposed in this paper). Experiments on
              real-life product reviews from a variety of domains show that

  number   = "August",
  abstract = "Many online human activities leave digital traces that are
              recorded in natural-language format. The exploitation of this
              unprecedented resource under a computational frame- work can bring
              a phase transition in our understanding of human social behavior
              and shape the future of social media systems. This thesis
              describes a computational ap- proach to an intriguing aspect of
              conversational behavior, linguistic style coordination:
              conversational participants tend to immediately and unconsciously
              adapt to each other's language styles; a speaker will even adjust
              the number of articles and other function words in their next
              utterance in response to the number in their partner's immediately
              preceding utterance. We develop a probabilistic framework that can
              model and quantify this phenomenon and apply it to four different
              conversational settings: Twitter conversations, discussions
              betweenWikipedia editors, oral arguments in the U.S. Supreme Court
              and movie script dialogs. We are able to examine linguistic style
              coordination in large scale settings for the first time, and by
              doing so, to reveal important properties that were never observed
              in previous studies, which were conducted mainly in small and
              controlled environments. The resulting new understanding of
              conversational behavior bears practical impor- tance in the task
              of uncovering key properties of social relations. We present an
              analysis framework based on linguistic coordination that can be
              used to shed light on power re- lationships and that works
              consistently across multiple types of power -- including a more
              ``static'' form of power based on status differences, and a more
              ``situational'' form of power in which one individual experiences
              a type of dependence on another. Finally, our computational
              framework can be employed to gain insight into the causal
              mechanism behind coordination behavior. It was previously
              hypothesized in the psycho-linguistic literature that coordination
              has arisen as a way to achieve social goals, such as gaining
              approval or emphasizing difference in status. But has the
              adaptation mechanism become so deeply embedded in the
              language-generation process as to be- come a reflex? We argue that
              fictional dialogs offer a way to study this question, since
              authors create the conversations but don't receive the social
              benefits (rather, the imag- ined characters do). Indeed, we find
              significant coordination across many families of function words in
              our large movie-script corpus. We thereby provide evidence that
              lan- guage coordination is so implanted within our conception of
              conversational behavior that, even if such coordination is
              socially motivated, it is exhibited even when the per- son
              generating the language in question is not receiving any of the
              presumed social advantages.",

              years. Given many name mentions in a document, the goal of EL is
              to predict their referent entities in a knowledge base.
              Traditionally, there have been two distinct directions of EL
              research: one focusing on the effects of mention's context
              compatibility, assuming that ``the referent entity of a mention is
              reflected by its context''; the other dealing with the effects of
              document's topic coherence, assuming that ``a mention's referent
              entity should be coherent with the document's main topics''. In
              this paper, we propose a generative model -- called entity-topic
              model, to effectively join the above two complementary directions
              together. By jointly modeling and exploiting the context
              compatibility, the topic coherence and the correlation between
              them, our model can accurately link all mentions in a document
              using both the local information (including the words and the
              mentions in a document) and the global knowledge (including the
              topic knowledge, the entity context knowledge and the entity name
              knowledge). Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of
              the proposed model.",

              natural language processing (such as clustering, summarizing, and
              detecting plagiarism). One approach to detecting paraphrases is to
              use predicate argument tuples. Although this approach achieves
              high paraphrase recall, its accuracy is generally low. Other
              approaches focus on matching similar words, but word meaning is
              often contextual (e.g., 'get along with,' 'look forward to'). An
              effective approach to detecting plagiarism would take into account
              the fact that plagiarists frequently cut and paste whole phrases
              and/or replace several words with similar words. This generally
              results in the paraphrased text containing identical phrases and
              similar words. Moreover, plagiarists usually insert and/or remove
              various minor words (prepositions, conjunctions, etc.) to both
              improve the naturalness and disguise the paraphrasing. We have
              developed a similarity matching (SimMat) metric for detecting
              paraphrases that is based on matching identical phrases and
              similar words and quantifying the minor words. The metric achieved
              the highest paraphrase detection accuracy (77.6\%) when it was
              combined with eight standard machine translation metrics. This
              accuracy is better than the 77.4\% rate achieved with the

              disappearing, and changing their meaning. These changes can be
              esti-mated using word representations in con-text, over time and
              across locations. A number of methods have been proposed to track
              these spatiotemporal changes but no general method exists to
              evaluate the quality of these representations. Previous work
              largely focused on qualitative eval-uation, which we improve by
              proposing a set of visualizations that highlight changes in text
              representation over both space and time. We demonstrate usefulness
              of novel spatiotemporal representations to explore and

              from European countries over a two-week period centered around the

              feeding them into a downstream classification task -- event type
              prediction. Thus, our work is the first to provide both intrinsic

              This paper presents a robust method for collective disambiguation,
              by harnessing context from knowledge bases and using a new form of
              coherence graph. It unifies prior approaches into a comprehensive
              framework that combines three measures: the prior probability of
              an entity being mentioned, the similarity between the contexts of
              a mention and a candidate entity, as well as the coherence among
              candidate entities for all mentions together. The method builds a
              weighted graph of mentions and candidate entities, and computes a
              dense subgraph that approximates the best joint mention-entity
              mapping. Experiments show that the new method significantly
              outperforms prior methods in terms of accuracy, with robust

              analysis of text, providing both a predictive model of future text
              and a latent topic representation of the corpus. Practitioners
              typically assume that the latent space is semantically meaningful.
              It is used to check models, summarize the corpus, and guide
              exploration of its contents. However, whether the latent space is
              interpretable is in need of quantitative evaluation. In this
              paper, we present new quantitative methods for measuring semantic
              meaning in inferred topics. We back these measures with
              large-scale user studies, showing that they capture aspects of the
              model that are undetected by previous measures of model quality
              based on held-out likelihood. Surprisingly, topic models which
              perform better on held-out likelihood may infer less semantically

              evaluated against several collections, 6 different languages and
              is compared to existing tools such as a stemmer and a lemmatizer.

  abstract = "This paper presents an algorithm for identifying the noun phrase
              antecedents of third person pronouns and lexical anaphors
              (reflexives and reciprocals). The algorithm applies to the
              syntactic representations generated by McCord's Slot Grammar
              parser and relies on salience measures derived from syntactic
              structure and a simple dynamic model of attentional state. Like
              the parser, the algorithm is implemented in Prolog. The authors
              have tested it extensively on computer manual texts and conducted
              a blind test on manual text containing 360 pronoun occurrences.
              The algorithm successfully identifies the antecedent of the
              pronoun for 86\% of these pronoun occurrences. The relative
              contributions of the algorithm's components to its overall success
              rate in this blind test are examined. Experiments were conducted
              with an enhancement of the algorithm that contributes
              statistically modelled information concerning semantic and
              real-world relations to the algorithm's decision procedure.
              Interestingly, this enhancement only marginally improves the
              algorithm's performance (by 2\%). The algorithm is compared with
              other approaches to anaphora resolution that have been proposed in
              the literature. In particular, the search procedure of Hobbs'
              algorithm was implemented in the Slot Grammar framework and
              applied to the sentences in teh blind test set. The authors'
              algorithm achieves a higher rate of success (4\%) than Hobbs'
              algorithm. The relation of the algorithm to the centering approach
              is discussed, as well as to models of anaphora resolution that
              invoke a variety of informational factors in ranking antecedent
              candidates.",

              tweets do not exist in a knowledge base (KB). In this paper we
              share ideas from information retrieval (IR) and NED to propose
              solutions for both challenges. For the first problem we make use
              of the gregarious nature of tweets to get enough context needed
              for disambiguation. For the second problem we look for an
              alternative home page if there is no Wikipedia page represents the
              entity. Given a mention, we obtain a list of Wikipedia candidates
              from YAGO KB in addition to top ranked pages from Google search
              engine. We use Support Vector Machine (SVM) to rank the candidate
              pages to find the best representative entities. Experiments
              conducted on two data sets show better disambiguation results
              compared with the baselines and a competitor.",

              characterize figurative language in naturally occurring

              framework to explore the social context in which figurative
              language is produced, showing that similes are more likely to

              problem, the entity linking decisions are critically depending on
              the heterogenous knowledge of entities. In this paper, we propose
              a generative probabilistic model, called entity-mention model,

              linked is modeled as a sample generated through a three-step
              generative story, and the entity knowledge is encoded in the
              distribution of entities in document P(e), the distribution of
              possible names of a specific entity P(s\e), and the distribution

              Since the social intentions of the speaker may differ from what is
              perceived by the hearer, systems that analyze human conversations
              need to be able to extract both the perceived and the intended
              social meaning. We investigate this difference between intention
              and perception by using a spoken corpus of speed-dates in which
              both the speaker and the listener rated the speaker on
              flirtatiousness. Our flirtation-detection system uses prosodic,
              dialogue, and lexical features to detect a speaker's intent to
              flirt with up to 71.5\% accuracy, significantly outperforming the
              baseline, but also outperforming the human inter-locuters. Our
              system addresses lexical feature sparsity given the small amount
              of training data by using an autoencoder network to map sparse
              lexical feature vectors into 30 compressed features. Our analysis
              shows that humans are very poor perceivers of intended
              flirtatiousness, instead often projecting their own intended

               To evaluate these methods we use known-similarity corpora that

              first task is a binary classification task which is to maximize
              accuracy of classification on an evenly-distributed test data set,
              given a fully labeled imbalanced training data set. The second
              task is also a binary classification task, but to maximize the
              F1-score of classification on a test data set, given a partially
              labeled training set. For task Technique), 1, I investigated
              several re-sampling techniques in improving the learning from the
              imbalanced data. These include SMOTE (Synthetic Minority
              Over-sampling Over- sampling by duplicating minority examples,
              random under- sampling. These techniques were used to create new
              balanced training data sets. Then three standard classifiers
              (Decision Tree, Na\"{\i}ve Bayes, Neural Network) were trained on
              the rebalanced training sets and used to classify the test set.
              The results showed the re-sampling techniques significantly
              improve the accuracy on the test set except for the Na\"{\i}ve
              Bayes classifier. For task 2, I implemented two- step strategy
              algorithm to learn a classifier from the only positive and
              unlabeled data. In step 1, I implemented Spy technique to extract
              reliable negative (RN) examples. In step 2, I then used the
              labeled positive examples and the reliable negative examples as
              training set to learn standard Na\"{\i}ve Bayes classifier. The
              results showed the two-step algorithm significantly improves the

              absent or re-duced in a suitably matched control condi-tion, in

              that the effects reported in recent literature must be

              frequency. These empirical observations are corrob-orated by
              analytical proofs that show that count representations introduce
              an inher-ent dependence on word frequency, and thus word frequency

              is able to outperform state of the art approaches on standard

              models the relationships between features, attributes, and classes
              as a two linear layers network, where the weights of the top layer
              are not learned but are given by the environment. We further
              provide a learning bound on the generalization error of this kind
              of approaches, by casting them as domain adaptation methods. In
              experiments carried out on three standard real datasets, we found

               curation and annotation of cultural heritage material is
               currently not well known. In this work, we create an experimental
               framework to measure the effects of different types of stylistic
               and social bias within training data for the purposes of literary
               classification, as one important subclass of cultural material.
               Because historical collections are often sparsely annotated, much
               like our knowledge of history is incomplete, researchers often
               cannot know the underlying distributions of different document
               types and their various sub-classes. This means that bias is
               likely to be an intrinsic feature of training data when it comes
               to cultural heritage material. Our aim in this study is to
               investigate which classification methods may help mitigate the
               effects of different types of bias within curated samples of
               training data. We find that machine learning techniques such as
               BERT or SVM are robust against reproducing the different kinds of
               bias within our test data, except in the most extreme cases. We
               hope that this work will spur further research into the potential
               effects of bias within training data for other cultural heritage

               of text contains a story. Prior approaches achieved a maximum
               performance of 0.66 F1, and did not generalize well across
               different corpora. We present a new state-of-the-art detector
               that achieves a maximum performance of 0.75 F1 (a 14\%
               improvement), with significantly greater generalizability than
               previous work. In particular, our detector achieves performance
               above 0.70 F1 across a variety of combinations of lexically
               different corpora for training and testing, as well as dramatic
               improvements (up to 4,000\%) in performance when trained on a
               small, disfluent data set. The new detector uses two basic types
               of features--ones related to events, and ones related to
               characters--totaling 283 specific features overall; previous
               detectors used tens of thousands of features, and so this
               detector represents a significant simplification along with
               increased performance.",
